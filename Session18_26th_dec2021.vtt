1
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.610
Sharat Chandra: So it is a try and look at what all things we have been done.

2
00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:22.950
Sharat Chandra: So as part of our journey we learned that we have to follow Chris DM or the latest one is Chris and mal que methodology, let me write crisper and Q amp D.

3
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.970
Sharat Chandra: And as part of this process management methodology six phases or six steps are there.

4
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.980
Sharat Chandra: And the first one is business and data understand that.

5
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.530
Sharat Chandra: This is more about gathering requirements and doing the planning.

6
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.680
Sharat Chandra: So here we have.

7
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.690
Sharat Chandra: planning.

8
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.440
Sharat Chandra: Gathering planning and researching this.

9
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.560
Sharat Chandra: posters, we learned about data pre processing.

10
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:09.270
Sharat Chandra: This is where we try to clean the data modify the data, if required, so we are we're basically doing a lot of manipulation syrup with respect to the data that we get and had.

11
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.190
Sharat Chandra: This is the most time consuming step.

12
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.750
Sharat Chandra: That.

13
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.140
Sharat Chandra: time consuming step.

14
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.950
Sharat Chandra: After data processing.

15
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.780
Sharat Chandra: We come to data mining steps.

16
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.790
Sharat Chandra: And this is where we are actually currently working with operating.

17
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.380
Sharat Chandra: Under data mining, we learned that there are unsupervised learning.

18
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.730
Sharat Chandra: Here we are not trying to do predict right.

19
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.210
Sharat Chandra: There is nothing like predicting any specific variable, so we will say bye is not known.

20
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.250
Sharat Chandra: This is not.

21
00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:04.110
Sharat Chandra: So if I don't have labeled the data, then, are not be trying to work for that labeled data right, it is all about identifying the hidden pattern, the date.

22
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.310
Sharat Chandra: And then we can do supervised.

23
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:20.430
Sharat Chandra: But before I talk about supervised learning, we also analyze that whenever we get the data we start with you need a period analysis.

24
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:32.460
Sharat Chandra: In order to understand the data and understand the details matter we try to look at uni variance analysis one variable at a time, and we do add on top of that, and by visualization.

25
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.700
Sharat Chandra: graphical representations.

26
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.990
Sharat Chandra: Post this we go to by various visualization.

27
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.410
Sharat Chandra: This is where we talked about two variables, taken together, will try to visualize it using scattered back.

28
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.620
Sharat Chandra: or try to identify the Cross table.

29
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.560
Sharat Chandra: Right confusion matrix kind of a thing we will get a pivot table.

30
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.180
Sharat Chandra: Then we have multivariate analysis.

31
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.510
Sharat Chandra: So while while we were doing these things.

32
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:17.790
Sharat Chandra: That we learned about various techniques, for example, all the unsupervised learning techniques are basically the techniques for doing the analysis in multi variable case.

33
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:30.510
Sharat Chandra: So clustering dimension deductions and all those concepts that we discussed association rules for all of them are for falling under you need a nexus.

34
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.840
Sharat Chandra: Post this.

35
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:50.130
Sharat Chandra: Right post, the analysis, we will also want to identify or predict the results and that's where we basically talked about supervised learning, and here we are saying label to data is there, so that is why he is known.

36
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.420
Sharat Chandra: Because I know what is the result, try to establish the relationship between the existing factors and.

37
00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.910
Sharat Chandra: Dubai.

38
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.760
Sharat Chandra: Right now under this scenario.

39
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.890
Sharat Chandra: If I have to predict why, which is numeric.

40
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.540
Sharat Chandra: Then we apply something called as regression techniques, and this is what we have to start learning.

41
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.630
Sharat Chandra: If I is non human.

42
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.900
Sharat Chandra: If I is non numeric then we look into classification.

43
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.270
Sharat Chandra: Classification techniques to a numeric non numeric regression or classification.

44
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.430
Sharat Chandra: Under classification techniques, we learned about.

45
00:04:45.630 --> 00:05:00.600
Sharat Chandra: knife based technique which runs on probability based concepts conditional probability, then we looked at K N, which stands on the distance logic nearest neighbor and then we discussed about decision to this.

46
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.070
Sharat Chandra: This is a rules based concepts.

47
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.040
Sharat Chandra: We also talked about.

48
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.170
Sharat Chandra: The complex models of n simple techniques.

49
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:24.870
Sharat Chandra: That we looked at and several techniques, this is nothing but a combination of multiple models and in and sample techniques.

50
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.320
Sharat Chandra: In and simple techniques, we looked at.

51
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.080
Sharat Chandra: four different variations.

52
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.180
Sharat Chandra: Voting.

53
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:35.880
Sharat Chandra: stacking.

54
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.900
Sharat Chandra: three models bagging.

55
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.470
Sharat Chandra: And finally, we had boosted.

56
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.020
Sharat Chandra: Voting and starting can be non three more based models as well.

57
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.600
Rachana Kumbha: Sir, sir.

58
00:05:52.590 --> 00:06:04.470
Rachana Kumbha: yeah so even like I was like looking at the fedex data set so like you know we were asked to give you know evaluate or use the data set on different models and like.

59
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:20.700
Rachana Kumbha: Tell like whichever model is having the highest accuracy like we can deploy that model so yeah like we can like use separately can and knife base and all or we can do, stalking as well, no so like if you're just stalking obviously the accuracy will be much more than the individual.

60
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:21.900
Sharat Chandra: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

61
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.720
Sharat Chandra: How can you say that stacking will improve the molecules.

62
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:32.940
Sharat Chandra: Logically, should be but let's say if I have model, one model to model three.

63
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.050
three models are there.

64
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.560
Sharat Chandra: Which are individually predicting on your fedex.

65
00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.440
Rachana Kumbha: OK OK.

66
00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.800
Sharat Chandra: So this will give me reserved one, this will give me reserve to this is giving me reserve.

67
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.180
Sharat Chandra: Now, what we are trying to find out is the value of our variable of our interest correct.

68
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:55.800
Sharat Chandra: Yes, so as you.

69
00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:02.460
Sharat Chandra: This model, one is giving very good result that is a very good, it is very close to the actual data.

70
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:10.380
Sharat Chandra: Okay, but these two are not so good they're deviating from the original.

71
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:16.950
Sharat Chandra: Okay, now, when you apply Meta modern final model.

72
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.990
Sharat Chandra: they're basically taking these as inputs and trying to predict why.

73
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.820
Sharat Chandra: The final result.

74
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.380
Rachana Kumbha: Okay.

75
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:38.940
Sharat Chandra: But because these two results are two and three are very, very deviating from the original data when you do average this good result will also be pulled away.

76
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.430
Rachana Kumbha: Yes, yes okay so.

77
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.860
Sharat Chandra: This challenge will always be there when you're doing.

78
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:51.600
Sharat Chandra: your thoughts are on that that is the reason why we evaluate individual models also.

79
00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:53.460
Rachana Kumbha: Okay.

80
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.690
Sharat Chandra: And then we compare it with a final assemble model.

81
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.800
Rachana Kumbha: So what if we need to do the individual products check individually and again to stalking also and then, once again verified.

82
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:05.580
Yes.

83
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:07.710
Rachana Kumbha: i've seen.

84
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:21.690
Rachana Kumbha: And like so it's like the problem statement is like are not correctly precisely what do you want is not like correctly given so it's like can we do like our own stuff like we can also have network analytics right because it's like source.

85
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:22.050
Sharat Chandra: In this.

86
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:23.580
Rachana Kumbha: nation is there, so we can do that.

87
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:24.360
We can.

88
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.430
Sharat Chandra: yeah he's a logic.

89
00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:34.560
Sharat Chandra: The logic of fedex data set right given as a project is for you people to do many things.

90
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.420
Sharat Chandra: So many things you have to also do business understanding.

91
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:40.170
Sharat Chandra: Yes.

92
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:50.820
Rachana Kumbha: misunderstanding So yes, so i've created a separate document so it's like i've written the what they call the objective like minimize maximize constraint, then prepare the data dictionary.

93
00:08:52.260 --> 00:09:03.630
Rachana Kumbha: Then, after that it's like like I thought i'd write, like every pre processing steps like why i'm doing it in the document so that it is clear, like every like data mining and also have just prepare that document.

94
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.630
Rachana Kumbha: says Oh, I thought i'll go through it.

95
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:08.820
Sharat Chandra: yeah see.

96
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.720
Sharat Chandra: There is no standard logic, I mean I need, but as a data scientist.

97
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:27.270
Sharat Chandra: You have free will basically in any organization as a data scientist, if you are hired right, you have a free will to look into all the aspects of the business and identify into the areas where there is a problem.

98
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:32.160
Rachana Kumbha: Okay, so it's like yes so.

99
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:34.560
Sharat Chandra: look good good.

100
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:46.770
Rachana Kumbha: is essentially a good objective so, is it sufficient if we can just try to minimize and maximise like what do you want to minimize and what do you want to maximize because you said, like octave optimize terminology should be there should be like very short.

101
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:53.910
Sharat Chandra: Okay, it is, it is see it is not mandatory, that you have to have them, it is recommended that you need to.

102
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.250
Rachana Kumbha: Okay, but it's like we don't have to give elaborate view of the objective right it's just that was.

103
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:05.430
Sharat Chandra: Not an objective is short crisp and optimization terminologies are recommended.

104
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:10.830
Sharat Chandra: Okay right, you might also want to explain what exactly you're trying to achieve.

105
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.760
Sharat Chandra: Okay, does this right a statement for.

106
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.490
Sharat Chandra: evaluator as a viewer if I see that statement.

107
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.310
Sharat Chandra: I may not be able to understand what what you're trying to do.

108
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.800
Sharat Chandra: Because I have not researched on the data right.

109
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.640
Rachana Kumbha: Yes, you.

110
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.500
Sharat Chandra: have to give an explanation also so.

111
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.480
Sharat Chandra: That it is clear for the person who's reading.

112
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:38.610
Rachana Kumbha: Okay, so what exactly i'm doing on the data like beat anything that work at analytics or you know distance and delay relation whatever we're planning to do, I can just put it in that document.

113
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.440
Rachana Kumbha: So just explain.

114
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:43.350
Sharat Chandra: Yes, yes, yes intimately you have to.

115
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.550
Sharat Chandra: give some insights to the business or the management.

116
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.220
Sharat Chandra: Okay, they can do better was.

117
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:56.280
Sharat Chandra: Okay last thing can be done dimension reduction can be done, like you said network analytics can be done.

118
00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:00.180
Sharat Chandra: Yes, right and then classification models are there.

119
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.950
Rachana Kumbha: Yes, okay.

120
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.740
Rachana Kumbha: Okay okay so okay so.

121
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:14.160
Sharat Chandra: Okay, so we're talking about this classification models and here we have voting stacking bagging and staying.

122
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.410
Sharat Chandra: right here under bagging again we discussed about.

123
00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:23.610
Sharat Chandra: Something.

124
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.520
Sharat Chandra: Which is very, very.

125
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:31.890
Sharat Chandra: efficient way to build things which is random forest.

126
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:37.170
Sharat Chandra: The difference here is, we will take a sample data which is.

127
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:46.710
Sharat Chandra: smiling bike capital m, this is your sample data for batty but for random forest, we will take subset of features as.

128
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.800
Sharat Chandra: Good that's the difference.

129
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.590
Sharat Chandra: Okay bad, there are no for us, this one variant of.

130
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.500
Sharat Chandra: Then we'll talk about boosting.

131
00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:01.950
Sharat Chandra: Under boosting we have.

132
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.350
Sharat Chandra: Added boosting.

133
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:15.300
Sharat Chandra: Then gradient descent and gradient boosting and then we have extreme gradient boosting and these models.

134
00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.010
Sharat Chandra: That try to minimize the error.

135
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.380
Sharat Chandra: By taking the models sequences by training the model sequence.

136
00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:31.530
Sharat Chandra: Here we take multiple sub samples and do training parallel.

137
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.810
Sharat Chandra: that's the difference between boosting and bagging techniques.

138
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:41.100
Sharat Chandra: So this is what we discussed Taylor.

139
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:44.400
Sharat Chandra: Now, if I talk about.

140
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.150
Sharat Chandra: Right being numeric piece.

141
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.030
Sharat Chandra: Okay, why is numeric.

142
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.560
Sharat Chandra: If this is the case.

143
00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:57.660
Sharat Chandra: Then.

144
00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.280
Sharat Chandra: We will try to go with something called as regression.

145
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:11.880
Sharat Chandra: But before I go ahead and deal with regression models, you need to try and understand certain things that that we discussed in the initials.

146
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:17.610
Sharat Chandra: So when I say why numeric.

147
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:30.450
Sharat Chandra: Why can be continuous or discrete okay numeric data can be continuous our district, we will now stick to the continuous case okay.

148
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:36.720
Sharat Chandra: If I is continuous.

149
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.130
Sharat Chandra: Then there are certain properties you remember this properties.

150
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:53.910
Rachana Kumbha: Yes, so I think it is mobility should be equal to zero always range will be like between minus infinity plus infinity.

151
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:59.760
Rachana Kumbha: And I think he area undercover will be equal to one and.

152
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.010
Something.

153
00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.600
Sharat Chandra: yeah this is.

154
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.450
Rachana Kumbha: This mean mean median and mode or equal.

155
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.850
Sharat Chandra: know that is when you have submitted the curves and.

156
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.550
Rachana Kumbha: All that that is normal distribution okay.

157
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.860
Sharat Chandra: we're only talking about continuous case.

158
00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:18.060
Rachana Kumbha: Okay okay So yes.

159
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.530
Sharat Chandra: Okay, of course, normal distribution and all that are our.

160
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:24.120
Sharat Chandra: Next steps.

161
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:32.730
Sharat Chandra: Okay, so if I have output variable y which is continuous in nature.

162
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:46.200
Sharat Chandra: Then, these are the important properties that we have to remember minus infinity plus infinity probability of identifying any single number is always being equal, to zero and area under the curve is always equal to one.

163
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:48.330
Sharat Chandra: click now.

164
00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:57.570
Sharat Chandra: let's say, am I asking you to predict something when something.

165
00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:02.100
Sharat Chandra: Okay, for example, months.

166
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:10.140
Sharat Chandra: In the classification scenario we identified whether the student will pass or.

167
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:11.490
Sharat Chandra: fail.

168
00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:20.640
Sharat Chandra: Okay, good I didn't define whether the student will be passing or failing, so this is non numeric it.

169
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.170
Sharat Chandra: will apply classification model.

170
00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:32.190
Sharat Chandra: But here we are talking about identifying the exact marks which is numerical.

171
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.670
Sharat Chandra: Now, if you apply a model and try to predict that so you're predicting okay whenever.

172
00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:48.930
Sharat Chandra: you're saying for a student the marks will be let's say 85% that the student is getting 85% marks.

173
00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:51.750
Sharat Chandra: If this is the case.

174
00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:54.600
Sharat Chandra: Right.

175
00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:58.320
Sharat Chandra: I mean if you're predicting.

176
00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:03.240
Sharat Chandra: What is the chance that the student is actually getting a defect marks.

177
00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.050
yeah.

178
00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.820
Sharat Chandra: What is the chance that the student is actually getting 85%.

179
00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:23.550
Sharat Chandra: anyway.

180
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.150
Sharat Chandra: let's say i'm predicting the marks for you.

181
00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:35.700
Sharat Chandra: i'm saying that you will get a difference, what is the chance that you will actually getting a difference.

182
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:45.630
Rachana Kumbha: If you don't know the student and probably percentage is anything out of hundred right so 285 is only a one number.

183
00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:55.770
Rachana Kumbha: If you are taking in terms of decimal points like 85 point, probably to be one by infinity which is like we cannot predict zero but.

184
00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:59.580
Rachana Kumbha: If you are considering it as though yes.

185
00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.100
Sharat Chandra: We are talking about marks which is.

186
00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:04.260
Rachana Kumbha: Continuous, then it is zero so.

187
00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:14.430
Sharat Chandra: Exactly, then it is you know, the chances zero, then why the hell i'm doing prediction if I know that the student is not going to get 85%.

188
00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.560
Sharat Chandra: That means whatever i'm predicting is wrong isn't it.

189
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:30.390
Sharat Chandra: These are the properties right for continuous data, these are the properties and and trying to predict the value, which is continue as and we are saying that the chance of the value zero.

190
00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.020
Sharat Chandra: Then the prediction.

191
00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:44.640
Rachana Kumbha: If you have historical data in the historical data like we can see that the student has like previously got like a lot of 85% ages, then we can try it in that way.

192
00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.140
Sharat Chandra: But we are dealing with.

193
00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.420
Sharat Chandra: population data here we're not dealing with.

194
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:55.050
Sharat Chandra: subset of data if it is a subset of data, then it becomes discrete, it is not continuous anymore, yes.

195
00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:08.730
Sharat Chandra: There are fixed values right So if you have hundred samples and hundred records that means you know exactly what is the value, so it becomes discrete if discrete there is no problem, we can do the right prediction classification models have been taught.

196
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.840
Sharat Chandra: That understanding, where i'm going here.

197
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:13.890
Rachana Kumbha: Yes, yes.

198
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.130
Sharat Chandra: So for a continuous data.

199
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.610
Sharat Chandra: How can I predict a single number.

200
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:32.850
Sharat Chandra: Right, because we are seeing the probability of a single number exit identify a single number on this infinity scale is zero.

201
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:44.280
Sharat Chandra: So how do I deal with it the continuous Dudes that that is all about this logic that were trying to understand, yet scholars confidence interval.

202
00:18:45.570 --> 00:19:02.400
Sharat Chandra: So, to start with continuous data, these are the three important properties that we discussed right area is equal to one property of a single number is equal to zero, and the range lies from minus infinity plus infinity if I extend this that Okay, these are.

203
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.910
Sharat Chandra: The data is actually normal.

204
00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:06.690
Sharat Chandra: I mean.

205
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:14.010
Sharat Chandra: they're not assuming that there is any abnormalities then it also has these two properties mean median equal to more.

206
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:23.460
Sharat Chandra: And then area is symmetric the curve asymmetric right and we also discuss normal distribution properties.

207
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:30.150
Sharat Chandra: Where the characterization of the bell shaped is done using these two.

208
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.530
Sharat Chandra: Right values, new and Sigma first moment and second.

209
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.860
Sharat Chandra: And we've also discussed about standardization.

210
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:51.210
Sharat Chandra: X minus meal by Sigma This is basically trying to transform the X values to the values.

211
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.380
Sharat Chandra: That we have we're moving the experiments to see by.

212
00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.060
Sharat Chandra: Training.

213
00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:04.470
Sharat Chandra: So these are all things that we have discussed, and of course we've also said that the.

214
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:09.660
Sharat Chandra: compassion right any data which is.

215
00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.910
Sharat Chandra: Continuous has to be assumed that it is normal.

216
00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.580
Sharat Chandra: But is it actually normal is verified using normal qq plot.

217
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:32.010
Sharat Chandra: Right and the Z values and the sample data should have identical distribution similar distribution.

218
00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.050
Sharat Chandra: If you do that.

219
00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.780
Sharat Chandra: You get a straight line and straight line basically means.

220
00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.830
Sharat Chandra: That the days normally is to be dead.

221
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:46.770
Sharat Chandra: These are all things we discussed right.

222
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:48.660
Sharat Chandra: Okay, remember.

223
00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:54.480
Sharat Chandra: Okay know.

224
00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:06.990
Sharat Chandra: Why, we are learning all these things, let us try and do a small example of doing prediction first how this prediction book right, so let us do the prediction.

225
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:12.780
Sharat Chandra: Then we will see the application of that right prediction calculations into another exam.

226
00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:18.270
Sharat Chandra: So here, I want to take a small data set.

227
00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:27.300
Sharat Chandra: Okay, this is the data set so we are looking at the gmat score.

228
00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:30.270
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

229
00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:31.620
Paramesh Putha: So one note.

230
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.240
Sharat Chandra: Here good good good.

231
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:46.140
Paramesh Putha: Actually, like therapy on the continuous data you're predicting students marks that the probability of your student getting 85% would be zero like if we have continuous data.

232
00:21:47.130 --> 00:22:01.740
Paramesh Putha: And if we have, like previous historical data like not particularly about the student but till now, some population data like based on the attributes like new record similarity with the old records, we can get the actual day like we can predict the percentage rate.

233
00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:04.620
Sharat Chandra: So that is similarity read it is not prediction.

234
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:14.100
Paramesh Putha: Okay, like normal machine learning algorithms for a supervised learning like that is what we have done by numeric.

235
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.760
Sharat Chandra: numeric data, we are not seeing.

236
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.130
Paramesh Putha: The regression regression models.

237
00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:23.160
Sharat Chandra: that's what we are going, we have not done that regression model yet.

238
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:23.940
Oh.

239
00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.010
Sharat Chandra: This world on let's let's discuss this here you got to know oh.

240
00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:30.420
Paramesh Putha: yeah.

241
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:32.400
Sharat Chandra: So let me load the data set.

242
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:32.970
here.

243
00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:40.170
Sharat Chandra: i'm talking about this specific gmat score state Okay, let me do histogram.

244
00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:49.080
Sharat Chandra: yeah G man, this is the is to go.

245
00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:53.790
Sharat Chandra: Which is histogram.

246
00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:00.150
Sharat Chandra: And the curve is basically left skewed.

247
00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:02.340
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

248
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:03.990
Sharat Chandra: Now.

249
00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:06.690
Sharat Chandra: Given this case.

250
00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:08.460
Sharat Chandra: Right.

251
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:11.910
Sharat Chandra: Remember, whatever data, we are working is always.

252
00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.030
Sharat Chandra: Given this sample data.

253
00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:24.330
Sharat Chandra: Can I make some strategies and applied for the university for admissions.

254
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:32.190
Sharat Chandra: And we've already discussed that because of the ship, we can conclude that the students right is left skewed us.

255
00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:45.840
Sharat Chandra: Because of the shape or left skewed behavior, we can clearly say that the examination was fairly easy to see, and that is the reason why we have not have basically people scoring high marks.

256
00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:47.910
Okay.

257
00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:49.890
Sharat Chandra: Now.

258
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.370
Sharat Chandra: Given this case let's say.

259
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.630
Sharat Chandra: You want to come up with strategies for admission.

260
00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.160
Sharat Chandra: Get students admission this year.

261
00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:05.340
Sharat Chandra: Right.

262
00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:13.170
Sharat Chandra: So each university will have their own strategies for admission right.

263
00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:21.420
Sharat Chandra: Given this data, what What would you basically come up with what is the plan that you will come up for.

264
00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:24.900
Sharat Chandra: Getting the.

265
00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:27.330
Sharat Chandra: I should say.

266
00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.760
Sharat Chandra: The admission strategy right, what does the education strategy that.

267
00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.690
Sharat Chandra: yeah guess what what strategies, would you want to.

268
00:24:49.080 --> 00:25:04.830
Rachana Kumbha: We can say is the exams over then make it, we can set the cutoff like depending on the market, which we can see my histogram like the peak like where it is a number of candidates, we we want to take for the university, we can set a cut off.

269
00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:16.710
Sharat Chandra: Very good, very good lifted another seats weekend and you have to basically free them up, and there are 773 students who have.

270
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:20.790
Sharat Chandra: students who have.

271
00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.050
Sharat Chandra: Written the exam sample data, this is sample data we have.

272
00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:30.660
Sharat Chandra: Okay, and we also looked into.

273
00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:41.250
Sharat Chandra: What is the minimum, what is the maximum maximum is seven at memon minimal mistakes and you can see that in the X axis good.

274
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.190
Sharat Chandra: Okay, so admission.

275
00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:54.720
Sharat Chandra: Then you have certain serendipity students minimum maximum we have mean, and we also have standard deviation as well.

276
00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:01.020
Sharat Chandra: It means is 711 standard deviation is 20.

277
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.820
Sharat Chandra: So, because I know the data we are coming up with all these PICs.

278
00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:09.960
Sharat Chandra: Right now.

279
00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:23.340
Sharat Chandra: If I have to let's say this is one of the universities that you are working as a team, you have to come up with the strategies, then that university will have some standard.

280
00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:34.710
Sharat Chandra: So you not ella every student who has written the exam Center is a qualification well, so all those people qualified for higher education so are there.

281
00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.240
Sharat Chandra: Right.

282
00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:44.730
Sharat Chandra: As a university right you don't want everyone to enter into your you could have cut off.

283
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:48.810
Sharat Chandra: Another question is what will be the cutoff.

284
00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.200
Sharat Chandra: get what will be the backup.

285
00:26:59.400 --> 00:26:59.910
Sharat Chandra: How much.

286
00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:01.050
You put us kind of.

287
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.030
Paramesh Putha: Or maybe depending on the top Marco thing by students, like some.

288
00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.830
Paramesh Putha: Top 10% or 90% of the students will be alone and.

289
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.040
Sharat Chandra: have to be very specific top 10 or 20.

290
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:17.880
yeah.

291
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:25.650
Rachana Kumbha: it's not there, then we can like see like based on the ranking like the top hundred.

292
00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:28.890
Sharat Chandra: Exactly Okay, this is only sample data.

293
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:30.960
Rachana Kumbha: Okay.

294
00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.810
Sharat Chandra: You have to generalize district.

295
00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:47.430
Sharat Chandra: Okay top 10 top 20 that is good.

296
00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:49.440
Sharat Chandra: That strategy is good.

297
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:51.870
Sharat Chandra: let's do that.

298
00:27:53.700 --> 00:28:10.740
Sharat Chandra: So, in order to decide see again, we are trying to be specific, with respect to the idea, not with respect to the values right optimization techniques basically talk about the idea being optimized and the best result can be captured.

299
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:17.550
Sharat Chandra: result will not be fixed it will change, based on the factors that we are considered okay.

300
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:20.610
Sharat Chandra: So if I say cut off.

301
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:22.500
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

302
00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:23.850
Sharat Chandra: Then.

303
00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.980
Sharat Chandra: What should be the ideal cutoff for this year.

304
00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:37.740
Sharat Chandra: Right, because the data is from the CSM and the the sample data that we're looking at is for the CSM.

305
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.800
Sharat Chandra: So if I see.

306
00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:48.360
Sharat Chandra: 625 is the cutoff then is this going to be a good quarter.

307
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:55.830
Sharat Chandra: Because cut off means we are trying to filter out those poorly performed students.

308
00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:05.190
Sharat Chandra: right and as a university, you might have 625 or you might also have six at as your standard.

309
00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.920
Sharat Chandra: So seats at.

310
00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:08.760
Sharat Chandra: This no.

311
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:09.750
Rachana Kumbha: No it's not.

312
00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:15.030
Rachana Kumbha: A very good cut off no Sir, because there are a lot of students who are have done very well.

313
00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:20.490
Rachana Kumbha: And like if the universities are top grade university then.

314
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:24.210
Rachana Kumbha: The cutoff should be like probability probably higher.

315
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:29.640
Sharat Chandra: let's say this is the university which isn't top 10 top 10 books okay.

316
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.160
Sharat Chandra: i'm impressed us.

317
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:34.380
Paramesh Putha: Okay, should we.

318
00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:39.300
Rachana Kumbha: should be higher, because many students have done and.

319
00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:44.700
Sharat Chandra: The question is, if you're putting six APS, the mind.

320
00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:51.360
Sharat Chandra: Then, what is the percentage of the students who are getting eliminated marks.

321
00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:53.370
Sharat Chandra: Fine you're seeing from 600.

322
00:29:53.940 --> 00:30:07.650
Sharat Chandra: To seven ad, this is the range and you're seeing success, it should be the cut of that means anyone who scored greater than six he will be qualified anything, who has less is disqualified very good, but how many people you are going to filter out.

323
00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:15.810
Sharat Chandra: hey What if your graph is like this if you say six at.

324
00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:18.690
Sharat Chandra: don't you eliminate a lot of people.

325
00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:23.970
Sharat Chandra: The 6600, and this is 785.

326
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:39.660
Sharat Chandra: Difficult examination, so in that key is a lot of students who scored around around about 680 or less so the percentage of the students who get eliminated is going to be very high here.

327
00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:41.430
Sharat Chandra: Right and.

328
00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.290
Sharat Chandra: If this is the case.

329
00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:53.040
Sharat Chandra: If this is the case and if I say six at here very, very limited very small number of students are getting filtered.

330
00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:56.340
Sharat Chandra: It means a lot of people are still available.

331
00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:58.260
Sharat Chandra: isn't it.

332
00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:11.790
Sharat Chandra: So you have only limited seats hundred hundred seats are available, so if I to six ad Am I filtering out a good amount of students or not.

333
00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:15.690
Sharat Chandra: Right, I said top.

334
00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:19.260
Sharat Chandra: 10 right Mona Lisa i'm assuming a lot of students are applying.

335
00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:25.020
Sharat Chandra: Right top 10 universities, a lot of people will have.

336
00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:35.730
Sharat Chandra: So the decision from the management has to be checked again every year, based on the distribution of the data.

337
00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:53.610
Sharat Chandra: Okay, if the examination is easy at this is the kind of distribution, you will see in this case the cutoff could be somewhere here if the examination was very difficult, then obviously a lot of students will score less mark so you're cut off should probably be around this way this space.

338
00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:59.490
Sharat Chandra: So that you give majority of the people right the apple logic.

339
00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:07.050
Sharat Chandra: That the logic is you, you allow a lot of students, good quality students to apply for the university.

340
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.400
Sharat Chandra: Now, can you tell me if I choose six at.

341
00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:15.660
Sharat Chandra: How much percentage of students are getting eliminate debt.

342
00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:33.840
Sharat Chandra: So if I have to get back remember area under the curve is one so we're basically saying.

343
00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:36.360
Sharat Chandra: This is the bell curve.

344
00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:43.980
Sharat Chandra: And i'm interested in this area.

345
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.890
Sharat Chandra: Okay i'm interested in this potion.

346
00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:57.210
Sharat Chandra: know how do I calculate area under this curve.

347
00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.170
Sharat Chandra: Because remember how do we calculate area.

348
00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:15.660
Sharat Chandra: Yes, how many of you actually remember calculus integrations.

349
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:24.180
Sharat Chandra: So this is.

350
00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:32.010
Sharat Chandra: This is upper limit 680.

351
00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:34.620
Sharat Chandra: And then I say fix.

352
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:39.030
Sharat Chandra: This is a representation right.

353
00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:48.900
Sharat Chandra: But the point is, what is the equation, we have the equation given.

354
00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:54.210
Rachana Kumbha: Well, so actually that's what I was thinking.

355
00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:56.970
Sharat Chandra: Exactly and.

356
00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:00.060
Sharat Chandra: Another challenges for every time the data chain.

357
00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:06.510
Sharat Chandra: Is, we have to get the equation again done right this entire area has to be calculated.

358
00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:21.570
Sharat Chandra: So for every small or big change, you will have to do a lot of mathematical calculations and there are so many different right continuous variables and for all of them, you don't have this equation equation was given fine can do that.

359
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:25.860
Sharat Chandra: So what is the alternative yet what can I do.

360
00:34:29.490 --> 00:34:39.600
Sharat Chandra: So here in order to capture the area under the curve, we will now comes the normal distribution guys, this is the application of normal distribution Center.

361
00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.080
Sharat Chandra: We are verifying i'm raising all this.

362
00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:46.830
stock, let me just erase all this.

363
00:34:48.390 --> 00:34:49.290
Sharat Chandra: unwarranted thanks.

364
00:34:50.910 --> 00:34:52.680
Sharat Chandra: Alright, so we're talking about.

365
00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.080
Sharat Chandra: Normal distribution.

366
00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:03.210
Sharat Chandra: Why, because this is continuously.

367
00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:14.790
Sharat Chandra: Of course, you know, to verify using normal qq plot or not yeah sooner than that and data is normally distributed to your G man data is normally distributed.

368
00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:21.150
Sharat Chandra: If this is normally distributed.

369
00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:23.790
Sharat Chandra: Right.

370
00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:29.970
Sharat Chandra: Then I can try to map it with Z scale.

371
00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:36.750
Sharat Chandra: isn't that means i'm trying to do standardization.

372
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:40.680
Sharat Chandra: I can do that right.

373
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:50.400
Sharat Chandra: Normal distribution G man, and then we are talking about standardization.

374
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:56.700
Sharat Chandra: I can do the standardization, because you might as normal distribution, remember that.

375
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:02.550
Sharat Chandra: So for every corresponding gmat score.

376
00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:07.890
Sharat Chandra: For every corresponding gmat score, we will have a corresponding value nz.

377
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:15.180
Sharat Chandra: But this is new and this is new, which is equal to zero, this is 711.

378
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:21.090
Sharat Chandra: And the standard deviation yet on see we have Sigma as one.

379
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.320
Sharat Chandra: Whereas on G matt the Sigma was 20.

380
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.310
Sharat Chandra: So i'm trying to map like.

381
00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:38.070
Sharat Chandra: We are trying to find out the area under the Belka for six a D.

382
00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:54.450
Sharat Chandra: So what is the corresponding Z value for 686 80 minus newest 711 Sigma is 29 these are standard values we already know data, so we can.

383
00:36:55.890 --> 00:37:15.540
Sharat Chandra: Get yeah can anyone tell me what is this reserve six at minus seven seven by 29 i'm taking the time to.

384
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:28.800
Sharat Chandra: pick C D minus seven.

385
00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.820
Rachana Kumbha: minus 1.06.

386
00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.700
Rachana Kumbha: minus 1.06.

387
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.130
Sharat Chandra: degrees.

388
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.290
minus 1.6.

389
00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:56.790
Sharat Chandra: hey so for X value that is Jim add value to succeed if I have to compare that with Z then on Z we have minus 1.6 right, but what is the.

390
00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.420
Sharat Chandra: Z is this standard.

391
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:05.580
Sharat Chandra: which follows normal distribution of course.

392
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:08.790
Sharat Chandra: Because it is standard.

393
00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:13.260
Sharat Chandra: It has certain property static properties right standard properties.

394
00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:15.570
Sharat Chandra: If it is standard.

395
00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:23.190
Sharat Chandra: Then statisticians right can also do a lot of calculations.

396
00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:27.750
Sharat Chandra: Because it has certain properties doesn't change so.

397
00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:34.020
Sharat Chandra: Using this logic statisticians have calculated.

398
00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:45.990
Sharat Chandra: area under the curve for different different Z values, because why Jesus symmetrical curve at the Center you'll have zero.

399
00:38:46.740 --> 00:39:04.710
Sharat Chandra: So I will be able to calculate the area under the curve this entire area under the curve is one but for a specific value what is it specific value what is it right, so these kind of calculations are already done, and they are stored in something called lessons Z table.

400
00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:09.600
Sharat Chandra: So let us look into the Z table here.

401
00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:12.090
Sharat Chandra: Let me minimize this.

402
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:28.800
Sharat Chandra: There is excluded it empties Z table remember this is a standard so fixed.

403
00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:30.780
Sharat Chandra: This thing will be.

404
00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:32.820
Sharat Chandra: The table.

405
00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.450
Sharat Chandra: We are trying to verify.

406
00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:43.890
Sharat Chandra: But this the table as we discussed is actually carry.

407
00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:45.930
Sharat Chandra: This Bush.

408
00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:50.160
Sharat Chandra: left side portion.

409
00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.590
Sharat Chandra: From see.

410
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.470
Sharat Chandra: I could do the calculations.

411
00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:00.510
Sharat Chandra: Because it is standard right.

412
00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:07.470
Sharat Chandra: So using this concept we are trying to now do the calculation for.

413
00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:09.750
60.

414
00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:16.440
Sharat Chandra: Zero minus 1.06 you guys did that calculation, this is the Z table.

415
00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.410
Sharat Chandra: happening, the link in the.

416
00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:28.200
Sharat Chandra: chat zoom chat you can just open it it doesn't the website it just search for 316 digit n g.com slash CT but you'll get this.

417
00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:32.370
Sharat Chandra: So when when we look at this.

418
00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:36.000
Sharat Chandra: I will have.

419
00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:41.640
Sharat Chandra: Z values on first corner.

420
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:47.790
Sharat Chandra: And you can see, the rules each show is speaking about one different Z value.

421
00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:57.390
Sharat Chandra: And the second decimal value this is with respect to first assessment, but the second decimal values are expressed in barrels.

422
00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.030
Sharat Chandra: Okay, so we need minus.

423
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:09.870
Sharat Chandra: 1.06 so how minus one yet.

424
00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:14.190
Sharat Chandra: minus 1.0 and 06.

425
00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:16.680
Sharat Chandra: that's that's what we're trying to get.

426
00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.190
Sharat Chandra: So minus one is here.

427
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:26.880
Sharat Chandra: And the second step disabled 06 right bring them together.

428
00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:38.460
Sharat Chandra: I get 0.1446 if I multiply this with hundred i'll get 14.46%.

429
00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:45.060
Sharat Chandra: Now, from a university perspective if you are applying cutoff.

430
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:48.090
Sharat Chandra: Are you willing to lose.

431
00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:53.130
say.

432
00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:57.780
Sharat Chandra: Are you willing to lose 15% of the students.

433
00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:02.940
Sharat Chandra: That that's The point of this.

434
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:09.720
Sharat Chandra: they're trying to see if you can lose 15% of the students.

435
00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:17.010
Sharat Chandra: If you if your management says no 15% is very big number I don't want to do so many people.

436
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:24.990
Sharat Chandra: Then, probably, you might want to reduce the society to a smaller value 60 or 70 years 75 whatever that is.

437
00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:27.540
Sharat Chandra: Right.

438
00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:35.460
Sharat Chandra: So if I say 660.

439
00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:39.330
Sharat Chandra: yeah can you guys tell me.

440
00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:59.550
Sharat Chandra: What will be the percentage of students who get filtered out if you choose the math to be less than 665 let's say 660 yeah because the minimum oxen 600, so I would try to see if it is 665.

441
00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:09.030
Sharat Chandra: yep, then what is the percentage of students, that we are using yeah.

442
00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:12.150
Sharat Chandra: Do the calculation of.

443
00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:37.860
Rachana Kumbha: 10 minus 1.58 so we have to check for like minus 1.5.

444
00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.770
Rachana Kumbha: And the minus 1.5 and it so.

445
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.630
Rachana Kumbha: Yes.

446
00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:51.210
Rachana Kumbha: So it's these 7.1% is it.

447
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.560
Sharat Chandra: Is a.

448
00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:56.820
Rachana Kumbha: high point sorry 5.5 point 7%.

449
00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:01.920
Sharat Chandra: Okay, to side with did everyone get minus 1.58 as a calculation for Z.

450
00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:08.610
Sharat Chandra: So we were basically having X from this X we're trying to calculate Z.

451
00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:17.100
Sharat Chandra: How by using the formula X minus MU by Sigma I already mentioned newest to 11 Sigma is 29.

452
00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:24.780
Sharat Chandra: yeah did everyone get the same result minus 1.58.

453
00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:28.890
Sharat Chandra: If yes, then good.

454
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:32.790
Sharat Chandra: After this, we are looking at.

455
00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:34.800
Sharat Chandra: The table.

456
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:41.940
Sharat Chandra: And we try to find out the value, which is right falling on that specific ad.

457
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:52.680
Rachana Kumbha: 05717 to 11 you have written.

458
00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:54.930
Rachana Kumbha: It was 711.

459
00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.620
Sharat Chandra: yeah okay so remember seven.

460
00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:06.750
Sharat Chandra: yeah if this is the case.

461
00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:12.900
Sharat Chandra: Then the area for this particular program is.

462
00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:17.880
Sharat Chandra: 5.71 percentage.

463
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:41.820
Sharat Chandra: Okay, so you're you're basically looking at a scenario where using the Z table standardization formula we are trying to assess the area under the curve and what we're saying is gmat score is normally distributed That means it will be similar to yours see.

464
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:53.370
Sharat Chandra: That the assumption right data is distributed normally means it is just like shape of the curve is just like see it may not be exactly the same, but we're saying it as similar.

465
00:45:54.360 --> 00:46:04.740
Sharat Chandra: Given this case, if I have to find out this area, then I tried to map that same value on Z and then i'll calculate this and that is nothing but you are.

466
00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:10.740
Sharat Chandra: clear to everyone.

467
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:20.310
Sharat Chandra: Any questions.

468
00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:32.430
Sharat Chandra: Now.

469
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.800
Sharat Chandra: yeah no go ahead.

470
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:36.090
NOOR ELAHI: Of.

471
00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:44.130
NOOR ELAHI: The curve is the constant function, no, no, no.

472
00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:45.780
NOOR ELAHI: No.

473
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:47.550
Sharat Chandra: Come again.

474
00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:48.990
NOOR ELAHI: Hello.

475
00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:51.180
Sharat Chandra: Hello.

476
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:52.890
Sharat Chandra: I can hear you.

477
00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:53.490
repeat.

478
00:46:58.290 --> 00:46:58.590
NOOR ELAHI: Yes.

479
00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:04.920
NOOR ELAHI: Sir, I just said, you know you got a question of this curve is the cost function like.

480
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:16.050
NOOR ELAHI: So one thing I would like you said before that the one thing I would like to know the significance of negative geez energy value.

481
00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:27.150
NOOR ELAHI: Or the positive value So can I interpret the the general things because somewhere in the G value is summer i'll get the positivity value and summer i'll get the negatives so.

482
00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:31.440
Sharat Chandra: there's nothing specific to interpret this is zero.

483
00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:34.140
Sharat Chandra: ne ne zero.

484
00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:39.390
Sharat Chandra: The values are spread across the sea table.

485
00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:53.580
NOOR ELAHI: Because i've actually or how can I say that, as you said, there is a lefty skew the data that the concentration of data is you know concentrated towards the right side it's left to school, yes, because the.

486
00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:55.260
NOOR ELAHI: mean as influential.

487
00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:57.390
Sharat Chandra: Know loads loads and loads of things.

488
00:47:58.350 --> 00:48:01.050
Sharat Chandra: Yes, but, but I see that.

489
00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:09.240
Sharat Chandra: The Z de mar data is not normal did I say that, or what was the discussion that we were having.

490
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:13.230
Sharat Chandra: dinner, assuming that decision.

491
00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:15.300
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

492
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:22.440
Sharat Chandra: So, if it is normal, we don't consider this kunis and all that we are assuming that everything is like a bell shaped curve.

493
00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:25.680
Sharat Chandra: Okay, practically.

494
00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:27.930
Sharat Chandra: Practically.

495
00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:34.200
Sharat Chandra: Even though G matt is showing a little kunis like this.

496
00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:40.470
Sharat Chandra: But when we try to look at or when you try to compare jima data with.

497
00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:43.980
Sharat Chandra: Standard Z value.

498
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.940
Sharat Chandra: Then we find that the line is straight on the normal qq plot.

499
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:51.480
NOOR ELAHI: Normal keep.

500
00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:58.920
Sharat Chandra: The data scattered in a straight line that means we are assuming it may not be perfectly straight, but overall pattern is a street and.

501
00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:02.340
Sharat Chandra: That means the data is normal.

502
00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:08.130
Sharat Chandra: This thing can be applied the logic that we are doing here right.

503
00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:17.790
Sharat Chandra: we've been very basically we're taking X, then we are trying to calculate the Z, then we are trying to calculate probability using Z table.

504
00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:27.660
Sharat Chandra: All this will be valued only when this is normally distributed, only then I can compare it with see right.

505
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:30.210
NOOR ELAHI: or.

506
00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:35.880
Sharat Chandra: If it is not normal and there is no point I do the comparison, because obviously this is not normally to skew.

507
00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:38.850
Sharat Chandra: Whereas Z will have a perfect will ship.

508
00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:40.950
Sharat Chandra: Right.

509
00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:42.510
NOOR ELAHI: Thank Thank you.

510
00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:49.140
Sharat Chandra: So we are assuming that data is not but.

511
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:51.870
Sharat Chandra: Only then we are doing all this.

512
00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:54.570
Sharat Chandra: Now.

513
00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:00.210
Sharat Chandra: I want also to give scholarships.

514
00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:09.330
Sharat Chandra: right as a being if I have to strategize something for admissions I also want to give some offers.

515
00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:22.860
Sharat Chandra: But these offers i'll give to only good performing students because eventually they are going to get into good jobs and they're going to get name to the institution to the university.

516
00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:29.160
Sharat Chandra: So we are we're trying to run offered scholarships, based on the performance.

517
00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:31.950
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

518
00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:37.860
Sharat Chandra: Another question.

519
00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:47.880
Rachana Kumbha: Can we consider like person tied in this case of scholarship like 90 percentile students who scored on 90 percentile or something like that.

520
00:50:48.090 --> 00:50:49.770
Sharat Chandra: Yes, yes, yes, that is what we are doing.

521
00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:50.850
Rachana Kumbha: OK OK.

522
00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:52.680
Sharat Chandra: So Vanessa six at.

523
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:56.850
Sharat Chandra: It is actually a point that point is percent.

524
00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:59.820
Sharat Chandra: below that you have 15% page.

525
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:01.680
Rachana Kumbha: OK OK OK, so at.

526
00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:04.320
Sharat Chandra: This point becomes 15%.

527
00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:05.580
Rachana Kumbha: Okay, so.

528
00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:11.010
Sharat Chandra: same day, I also want to give scholarship.

529
00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:13.980
Sharat Chandra: only to those students who have secured very good.

530
00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:16.170
Sharat Chandra: Right.

531
00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:18.330
Sharat Chandra: So how about.

532
00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:22.230
Sharat Chandra: coming to a conclusion on what value should.

533
00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:26.550
Sharat Chandra: Here we use succeed on the left side.

534
00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:28.980
Sharat Chandra: But on the right side.

535
00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.130
Sharat Chandra: Maybe i'll say.

536
00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:39.000
Sharat Chandra: The maximum Marcus 780.

537
00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:40.830
Sharat Chandra: So i'll give.

538
00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:46.470
Sharat Chandra: scholarship to let's save.

539
00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:49.050
Sharat Chandra: Seven 770.

540
00:51:54.300 --> 00:52:00.570
Sharat Chandra: i'm going to tell that all the students will get scholarship if their score greater than 70.

541
00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:17.850
Sharat Chandra: Now, if I declare this, then how many students are going to fall in that section, because all for all of them, I have to give the scholars, will this be a good idea to randomly just declare the scholarship based on them.

542
00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:22.530
Sharat Chandra: Again, because if it isn't easy exam.

543
00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:26.460
Sharat Chandra: lot of students will fall in this area.

544
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:30.480
Sharat Chandra: Linden.

545
00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:40.980
Sharat Chandra: If this is the GIs then obviously i'm going to go into losses because free educational scholarship right.

546
00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:44.910
Sharat Chandra: If you're declining scholarship then a lot of people are getting into.

547
00:52:46.770 --> 00:52:47.340
Sharat Chandra: This bracket.

548
00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:55.530
Sharat Chandra: isn't it so in this kind of scenario, maybe I want to reduce this reach to a smaller value.

549
00:52:57.450 --> 00:53:00.990
Sharat Chandra: Right So how do we deal with this, can you tell me.

550
00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:06.450
Sharat Chandra: Can you tell me.

551
00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.100
Sharat Chandra: What is the.

552
00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:13.710
Sharat Chandra: percentage of students who have actually got marks greater than 70.

553
00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:15.000
Sharat Chandra: yeah.

554
00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:50.970
Rachana Kumbha: So for that we need to know, like the data right like the number of students who got what do they call.

555
00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:55.710
Rachana Kumbha: About 770 and on by the total number of students.

556
00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:57.330
Sharat Chandra: Did you get the.

557
00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:02.160
Sharat Chandra: same number of students who got say the much less than 630.

558
00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:04.920
Rachana Kumbha: OK OK OK so i'm going.

559
00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:06.180
Sharat Chandra: To do the calculation.

560
00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:07.110
Rachana Kumbha: Yes, yes, Sir, yes.

561
00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:41.520
Rachana Kumbha: So, so the Z value is 2.03.

562
00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:43.170
Rachana Kumbha: So.

563
00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:48.810
Rachana Kumbha: We need to check for like the percentage of 2.03 for the Z value.

564
00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:51.330
Sharat Chandra: yeah you're absolutely right we'll open it open it.

565
00:54:51.450 --> 00:54:52.020
Rachana Kumbha: Okay okay.

566
00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:54.690
yeah whatever and others.

567
00:54:56.730 --> 00:55:00.210
Sharat Chandra: Okay, good Okay, the bus responded.

568
00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:14.580
Rachana Kumbha: said I got my answer is.

569
00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:33.900
97.8890407 72.38%.

570
00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.860
Paramesh Putha: Less than 2% will be people that she.

571
00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:40.650
Sharat Chandra: Very good, yes.

572
00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:46.050
Sharat Chandra: see what we're trying to understand here is greater than service.

573
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:52.110
Sharat Chandra: So if I have been shaped curve and saying this is 770.

574
00:55:53.220 --> 00:56:07.320
Sharat Chandra: So when you use the seat table always remembers the table does the calculations, so this is lower limit then upper limit and then function of X dx so always it takes the.

575
00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:20.700
Sharat Chandra: left side Bush and oversight for doing the calculations very so try say seven seven D, it is assuming that from here, everything.

576
00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:29.910
Sharat Chandra: read all this data, and when you refer to the table you're getting somewhere around 98% down to the ground, it off.

577
00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:35.100
Sharat Chandra: But i'm not interested in the Left set portion interested in greater than.

578
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:39.210
Sharat Chandra: data and so that means we're interested in this portion.

579
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:45.240
Sharat Chandra: The end of the total curve is 100% right.

580
00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:52.470
Sharat Chandra: So we are taking only 2% by removing that 98% of the data.

581
00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:58.020
Sharat Chandra: Good.

582
00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:01.290
Sharat Chandra: Is it clear.

583
00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:02.130
Yes.

584
00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:10.470
Sharat Chandra: So the table is actually referring to the left side portion of Z.

585
00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:14.130
Sharat Chandra: cumulative portion.

586
00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:27.510
Sharat Chandra: So the new look at that we are getting 98.2% 98% if I convert that it is to push.

587
00:57:30.210 --> 00:57:36.540
Sharat Chandra: It off right and shaded push right, I should say area of the curve, where you have red colored lights.

588
00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:42.810
Sharat Chandra: So that means, if I can.

589
00:57:43.830 --> 00:57:44.850
Sharat Chandra: Have a budget.

590
00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:49.710
Sharat Chandra: Then I can decide what will be the cutoff values.

591
00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:58.740
Sharat Chandra: Right in order to get the area and the local and area under the curve, is nothing but your probability or portion.

592
00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:06.810
Sharat Chandra: So this is how Z table is used for to indicate.

593
00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:15.060
Sharat Chandra: Okay, but always remember it is only looking at left side portion of this.

594
00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:18.090
Okay.

595
00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:29.550
Sharat Chandra: Okay now.

596
00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:44.550
Sharat Chandra: Using the standard ization for.

597
00:58:47.970 --> 00:59:04.680
Sharat Chandra: Using this standardization for law to map the X values to see when US and because these standard the calculations are already done for this table using this as a reference, we are trying to evaluate the values for the kind of it.

598
00:59:07.530 --> 00:59:13.890
Sharat Chandra: Okay, these are the conditions that we talked minus 1.06 it is 14% if I have to want.

599
00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:26.880
Sharat Chandra: It and these calculations, if I have higher value than we say greater than value and that's I think what one minus the left side portion gives you the right side push.

600
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:42.240
Sharat Chandra: But all this is possible only when your data is normally distributed if data is not normal all this doesn't make any sense, so if data is not normal What should we do, or what we do.

601
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:48.030
Sharat Chandra: yeah if data is not normal.

602
00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:51.210
Sharat Chandra: What we do.

603
00:59:58.080 --> 00:59:59.580
Sharat Chandra: We discuss this long time.

604
01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:06.330
Sharat Chandra: If data is polled that form to be non normal.

605
01:00:07.830 --> 01:00:09.750
Rachana Kumbha: Always normalize the data right.

606
01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:13.260
Sharat Chandra: But what is the process called last.

607
01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:15.060
Rachana Kumbha: normalization or.

608
01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:17.520
Rachana Kumbha: Standardization standardization is continuous.

609
01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:21.570
Sharat Chandra: it's not normalization of standardization.

610
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:24.210
Rachana Kumbha: As one solution, I think.

611
01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:26.010
Sharat Chandra: i'm summations very.

612
01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:29.490
Sharat Chandra: Good, the answer is transformations.

613
01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.090
Sharat Chandra: We transform.

614
01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:47.010
Sharat Chandra: The Non non data to novelty once we get the transform data we do the calculations get the results transform it back to those you know scale and then evaluate or interpret the results.

615
01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:56.100
Sharat Chandra: yeah right, so this is normal qq plot strategy without normality, we cannot proceed for.

616
01:01:00.330 --> 01:01:11.280
Sharat Chandra: Okay, so next is very important point we'll discuss that in a moment we'll take shortcuts yeah this time i'll give you more brains, but shorter duration.

617
01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:20.670
Sharat Chandra: So in my watch it's 373 to five minutes break come back with me okay.

618
01:01:23.010 --> 01:01:23.310
Paramesh Putha: yeah.

619
01:01:34.050 --> 01:01:34.500
Sharat Chandra: Everyone.

620
01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:46.620
Sharat Chandra: Alright, so we just discussed on how we do calculation.

621
01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:50.340
Sharat Chandra: To get area under the curve.

622
01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:56.040
Sharat Chandra: This is nothing but the probability.

623
01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:02.040
Sharat Chandra: Now this probability calculations are useful for doing for addiction.

624
01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:04.860
Sharat Chandra: As you can see.

625
01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.210
Sharat Chandra: If you have do you mad scores.

626
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:16.800
Sharat Chandra: Then, what is the chance that the student that I had randomly pick is having.

627
01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:32.880
Sharat Chandra: marks greater than let's say seven but less than 700 right, so this way we can try to use this area logic to calculate probability or prediction.

628
01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:41.250
Sharat Chandra: And this this concept is basically applied for value, which is continuous in nature.

629
01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:45.480
Sharat Chandra: And in order to do this calculation, we look at.

630
01:02:47.400 --> 01:03:04.620
Sharat Chandra: It we are looking at the normal distribution properties why because the value is continues, and if it has continued as it has to be normally distributed, if not we convert that to become not but and once we have normally distributed data in we compare it with Z.

631
01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:10.200
Sharat Chandra: And nz we basically use the table.

632
01:03:12.570 --> 01:03:19.890
Sharat Chandra: we're using the table in order to calculate the area under the curve and if I know the potion.

633
01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:28.020
Sharat Chandra: With respect to the corresponding ziva you have X, then the area under the curve will remain say.

634
01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:32.040
Sharat Chandra: irrevocable remains.

635
01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:41.790
Sharat Chandra: So this this Z table is Alice to actually calculate the probability or area for your random variable X.

636
01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:46.950
Sharat Chandra: So that's normal qq plot for us.

637
01:03:50.010 --> 01:03:50.370
Sharat Chandra: Now.

638
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:57.540
Sharat Chandra: This is with respect to you need a good analysis Okay, when you have a single variable we tend to do this.

639
01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:03.810
Sharat Chandra: But let's say you have multiple variables and all those those cases are coming.

640
01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:10.470
Sharat Chandra: Okay, and what we're basically saying is when we are trying to do the prediction.

641
01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:26.940
Sharat Chandra: Trying to do the prediction will always work with sample data, this is your inferential statistics concept will never get population data, the 773 students that we work with.

642
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.890
Sharat Chandra: Right.

643
01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:34.050
Sharat Chandra: This is also a sample, this is not population.

644
01:04:35.070 --> 01:04:35.430
Okay.

645
01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:38.700
Sharat Chandra: Now let us assume.

646
01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:41.280
Sharat Chandra: I give you.

647
01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:51.840
Sharat Chandra: Data let's say this is my data okay 123456.

648
01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:53.640
Sharat Chandra: A day.

649
01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:56.790
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

650
01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:05.280
Sharat Chandra: When we talk about die, it has six possible outcomes, this has made our number 36 possible.

651
01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:07.470
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

652
01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:12.570
Sharat Chandra: If you basically let's say.

653
01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:14.430
Sharat Chandra: Roll the dice.

654
01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:18.870
Sharat Chandra: Four times, or three times.

655
01:05:20.490 --> 01:05:22.410
Sharat Chandra: Roll that particular day three types.

656
01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:29.640
Sharat Chandra: Right let's see which now has done the ruling of this day three days.

657
01:05:31.530 --> 01:05:47.040
Sharat Chandra: Okay, so this is my sample one randomly you might get one result for each direct and bedroom so give me some three random numbers out of the six assume that you're rolling the dice you got three results right so from that perspective.

658
01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:54.150
Sharat Chandra: Three five and 635613 times.

659
01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:01.920
Sharat Chandra: So you're basically having the results as three, five and one now let's say no, you don't.

660
01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:03.480
notice.

661
01:06:04.770 --> 01:06:09.930
Sharat Chandra: repeating this exercise, you are you're also randomly repeating right, so what might you get.

662
01:06:13.110 --> 01:06:14.100
Sharat Chandra: Give me three numbers.

663
01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:20.310
Sharat Chandra: And it's all good.

664
01:06:22.410 --> 01:06:22.620
NOOR ELAHI: yeah.

665
01:06:22.650 --> 01:06:26.610
Sharat Chandra: Next manali couple you might want to get your own.

666
01:06:27.690 --> 01:06:30.000
Sharat Chandra: Yemen your your experiment results.

667
01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:33.690
Monali s: yeah see see for you guys.

668
01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:37.530
Sharat Chandra: Okay, want to give the same results okay.

669
01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:41.130
Sharat Chandra: it's for.

670
01:06:43.110 --> 01:06:44.940
Sharat Chandra: yeah probably you might want to give them.

671
01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:53.850
neerupa chauhan: A six four and three okay.

672
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:57.390
Sharat Chandra: 643 random guys don't give it too much of thought.

673
01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:58.650
it's just random output.

674
01:07:01.290 --> 01:07:13.500
Sharat Chandra: yeah so sampling five samples except they cannot so everyone asked me one so just bear with me on that so let's see we have 100 people and i've asked all the hundred people to do this experiment.

675
01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:24.690
Sharat Chandra: For all the hundred people, we will get random visits right, it may baby, or it may be same also lights you don't know.

676
01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:31.590
Sharat Chandra: Each of this role, I experiment is a sample.

677
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:33.480
Sharat Chandra: Right.

678
01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:37.110
Sharat Chandra: Now, on this sample.

679
01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:39.660
Sharat Chandra: We will be doing the calibration.

680
01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:46.080
Sharat Chandra: Okay, now, what is the average of this.

681
01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.030
Sharat Chandra: Have it will be three right.

682
01:07:58.770 --> 01:08:00.180
Sharat Chandra: What is the average of this.

683
01:08:03.210 --> 01:08:07.920
Sharat Chandra: 11 by three probably it is 3.6.

684
01:08:09.330 --> 01:08:11.730
Sharat Chandra: This one again three this one.

685
01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:16.740
Sharat Chandra: That team point 3014 four point.

686
01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:20.940
Sharat Chandra: So on so forth i'm getting different results.

687
01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:25.620
Sharat Chandra: What is the average of this actual population data.

688
01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:33.000
Sharat Chandra: yeah what is the other job.

689
01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:41.700
NOOR ELAHI: All right, to bring something.

690
01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:52.920
Sharat Chandra: Different something like 3.5 3.5 average of 123456 is middle value 2.5.

691
01:08:55.080 --> 01:09:03.750
Sharat Chandra: So what i'm trying to explain here is when we do inferential statistics when we're trying to do inferential statistics.

692
01:09:06.210 --> 01:09:14.790
Sharat Chandra: We always work with sample data only but that sample data, maybe.

693
01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:20.040
Sharat Chandra: Your sample data itself might vary.

694
01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:28.170
Sharat Chandra: If you're on the line data various the statistics that you are going to get will also very.

695
01:09:29.370 --> 01:09:29.730
Sharat Chandra: Good.

696
01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:36.120
Sharat Chandra: isn't it.

697
01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:47.940
Sharat Chandra: Then among all these different samples that I have has 100 samples.

698
01:09:50.130 --> 01:09:58.530
Sharat Chandra: Out of all the samples who sample should I choose because I don't know this and i'm trying to calculate it from a business perspective.

699
01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.530
Sharat Chandra: Right so, for example.

700
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:12.090
Sharat Chandra: I want to identify a standard example I want to identify it employee's salary I love this exam.

701
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:23.040
Sharat Chandra: All the IP employees salary is what I want to identify let's say in India will will limit limit to India.

702
01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:31.710
Sharat Chandra: This is your population return you're interested in finding population parameters.

703
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.810
Sharat Chandra: But, will you get all the employees D is will that be possible.

704
01:10:41.250 --> 01:10:43.110
Sharat Chandra: If I asked me people to do this.

705
01:10:46.410 --> 01:10:47.160
Sharat Chandra: What will you do.

706
01:10:49.230 --> 01:10:52.770
Sharat Chandra: You probably probably try to write conduct this way.

707
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:55.680
Sharat Chandra: and gather data.

708
01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:59.760
Sharat Chandra: Because you're not have got a right readily available date.

709
01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:03.780
Sharat Chandra: And nobody directly discloses the salary.

710
01:11:05.370 --> 01:11:09.330
Sharat Chandra: So trying to ask some people, and some people may respond some people may not respond.

711
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:10.830
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

712
01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:14.130
Sharat Chandra: So gather data.

713
01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.830
Sharat Chandra: Now, do you think.

714
01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:25.200
Sharat Chandra: The surveys right the data that let's say de Monte is going to get.

715
01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:34.080
Sharat Chandra: will be the same data that everybody will also get God Murray manali in the report now everybody.

716
01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:36.870
Sharat Chandra: i'd be getting the same data.

717
01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:47.970
Sharat Chandra: Know Dave is doing his own survey he's trying to reach out to his network people right.

718
01:11:50.010 --> 01:11:59.160
Sharat Chandra: Maybe his close associates close friends immediate family members so on so forth we're working in it department, there was going to get information from those people.

719
01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:17.100
Sharat Chandra: hey Similarly, if I talk about let's say permission permissions going to get the same information from this net rockstar is going to get the data from right that that particular network that that she is associated.

720
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.920
Sharat Chandra: Right.

721
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:21.480
Sharat Chandra: But.

722
01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:25.470
Sharat Chandra: Everybody is going to talk about.

723
01:12:26.670 --> 01:12:27.750
Sharat Chandra: Population parameter.

724
01:12:30.210 --> 01:12:37.350
Sharat Chandra: Linda they're trying to represent inferential statistics means that only right take statistics and then estimated to population.

725
01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:42.210
Sharat Chandra: Now among all your calculations, whose calculation, should I choose.

726
01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:48.780
Sharat Chandra: is no current Dave carrot carrot carrot who's correct.

727
01:12:52.170 --> 01:12:54.750
Sharat Chandra: Everybody is correct, because the logic that knowing is correct.

728
01:12:55.890 --> 01:13:00.090
Sharat Chandra: But because the underlying logic underlying data is changing.

729
01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:17.490
Sharat Chandra: The results are also going to change, so you cannot you cannot basically consider different different results for population parameter the parameters here is always fixed I mean one result or a parameter should be one reason.

730
01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:22.710
Sharat Chandra: But that's not gonna happen because samples are changing.

731
01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:42.120
Sharat Chandra: So, if this is the problem when we are trying to deal with inferential statistics and this problem is called as sampling variations or sample variation.

732
01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:45.840
Sharat Chandra: If this is your population.

733
01:13:47.310 --> 01:13:50.130
Sharat Chandra: As you perform and is assume this is your population.

734
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:54.030
Sharat Chandra: Whenever we say population we're assuming that we don't know that.

735
01:13:55.290 --> 01:14:08.100
Sharat Chandra: But on this population, I have to calculate view and then for these numbers, the population is 33 because I know the data, you can also do the calculation, the right values will be at the to.

736
01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:13.200
Sharat Chandra: know in order to calculate the population.

737
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:24.660
Sharat Chandra: If I don't know the population, then we will go first sample data assuming sample sizes to collect the data and then these are all the possible samples that I have.

738
01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:36.960
Sharat Chandra: Not depleting if it has to be known to pretend that these are the samples that I have on each of the samples has equal probability.

739
01:14:41.370 --> 01:14:43.590
Sharat Chandra: you're losing unbiased techniques right.

740
01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:49.050
Sharat Chandra: So each of the sample will have equal opportunity to get select.

741
01:14:50.970 --> 01:14:51.330
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

742
01:14:53.310 --> 01:15:01.530
Sharat Chandra: You may end up getting sample one or you may end up getting sample for our sample file or any time.

743
01:15:02.730 --> 01:15:15.630
Sharat Chandra: So if I have all these multiple samples, we may end up going into any of these samples, and for those respective samples the status thing that you are telecommuting he's giving us different different results.

744
01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:20.550
Sharat Chandra: Now, if I don't know population i'll consider it all correct.

745
01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:27.810
Sharat Chandra: But is the mean if I do reverse engineering is this mean 29 equal to 33.

746
01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:29.970
Sharat Chandra: No.

747
01:15:32.010 --> 01:15:35.490
Sharat Chandra: Right or 37 if you say that is also not equal to 33.

748
01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:43.290
Sharat Chandra: So the sample that you are going to work with may or may not give you the exact population.

749
01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:47.280
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

750
01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:56.880
Sharat Chandra: So to deal with this problem we have something called less central limit theorem.

751
01:15:58.890 --> 01:16:00.420
Sharat Chandra: keep us in the next slide we'll talk about that.

752
01:16:01.710 --> 01:16:06.720
Sharat Chandra: So sampling variations, once again we are talking about samples that we are collecting.

753
01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:10.530
Sharat Chandra: being very they keep changing.

754
01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:21.240
Sharat Chandra: And because we are using the sample data which keeps changing the underlying data may or may not give you the appropriate statistics.

755
01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:26.880
Sharat Chandra: Right, so we may get different different results.

756
01:16:28.890 --> 01:16:36.600
Sharat Chandra: If i'm using unbiased techniques, I may get any of these samples, that means the sample selection is a random.

757
01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:41.820
Sharat Chandra: Random service technically random selection happens.

758
01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:56.010
Sharat Chandra: So, if your sample and the leg sample is getting randomly selected the calculations, will also be and these results that you're seeing are going to be random So if I consider this as my data and.

759
01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:59.460
Sharat Chandra: This become my random variable.

760
01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:04.050
Sharat Chandra: Because the values are random each so it's it's also running.

761
01:17:08.010 --> 01:17:09.450
Sharat Chandra: Okay, one question to you or.

762
01:17:11.190 --> 01:17:15.720
Sharat Chandra: Whatever that we get a calibrations that we're talking about with respect to statistics.

763
01:17:18.210 --> 01:17:19.950
Sharat Chandra: What results, we will get.

764
01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:26.070
Sharat Chandra: If I say mean if I say median median median may not be a parameter.

765
01:17:27.330 --> 01:17:28.920
Sharat Chandra: Since that non parametric case.

766
01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:33.780
Sharat Chandra: So any statistic value that we talked about reasons or.

767
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:37.470
Sharat Chandra: excuses or courses or right.

768
01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:40.170
Sharat Chandra: This mean.

769
01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:45.060
Sharat Chandra: yeah.

770
01:17:46.770 --> 01:17:49.770
Sharat Chandra: I love the data, what is the data type that we are going to.

771
01:17:51.930 --> 01:17:53.520
Sharat Chandra: put all the statistics that we talked about.

772
01:18:02.610 --> 01:18:03.870
Sharat Chandra: What is going to be the data.

773
01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:08.370
Sharat Chandra: descriptor of continuous.

774
01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:13.050
Sharat Chandra: discrete.

775
01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:14.790
Sharat Chandra: Are you sure.

776
01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:31.980
Sharat Chandra: 123456 what is the average you know.

777
01:18:35.670 --> 01:18:45.510
Rachana Kumbha: So when you're taking me in on when you're doing some calculations on some data, there is always chance at the answer will be like in a proper decimal format, so it may be continuous mostly.

778
01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:47.670
Sharat Chandra: It has to be continued.

779
01:18:47.730 --> 01:18:48.660
Rachana Kumbha: Yes, yes, so.

780
01:18:50.490 --> 01:18:52.320
Sharat Chandra: Any statistic that you want to get.

781
01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:55.740
Sharat Chandra: It right, it will always be continuing, that is.

782
01:18:56.970 --> 01:18:59.850
Sharat Chandra: Again, another standard concept that you have to remember.

783
01:19:02.850 --> 01:19:03.240
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

784
01:19:05.250 --> 01:19:09.030
Sharat Chandra: it's a bigger type of your statistic is always continues, no.

785
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:12.030
Sharat Chandra: Not district.

786
01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:16.980
Sharat Chandra: In this example, it is shown with discrete examples.

787
01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:18.630
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

788
01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:21.930
yeah.

789
01:19:26.370 --> 01:19:26.700
Sharat Chandra: know.

790
01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:31.650
Sharat Chandra: If this is continuous data.

791
01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:37.410
Sharat Chandra: The statistic that we are talking about is up continuously.

792
01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:40.470
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

793
01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:43.440
Sharat Chandra: And we are trying to find out.

794
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:45.720
Sharat Chandra: One value.

795
01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:47.940
Sharat Chandra: Of this data.

796
01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:52.200
Sharat Chandra: hey.

797
01:19:53.730 --> 01:19:57.510
Sharat Chandra: we're interested in getting one value out of this entire continuous data.

798
01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:03.630
Sharat Chandra: Property i'm in the chance of getting.

799
01:20:04.650 --> 01:20:05.580
Sharat Chandra: That one value.

800
01:20:06.690 --> 01:20:07.530
Sharat Chandra: What does a chance.

801
01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:12.870
Rachana Kumbha: zero.

802
01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:14.640
Sharat Chandra: Exactly.

803
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:21.120
Sharat Chandra: good chance of getting exactly that one value will be zero.

804
01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:23.130
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

805
01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:34.290
Sharat Chandra: So, using all these concepts statisticians have thoroughly understood the pattern behavior of this data.

806
01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:37.800
Sharat Chandra: And what they have observed is.

807
01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:43.620
Sharat Chandra: That distribution of the sample status to talk about mania.

808
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:47.730
Sharat Chandra: The distribution is all with normal.

809
01:20:49.650 --> 01:20:54.000
Sharat Chandra: Okay respective whether it is coming from data which is normal or not.

810
01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:59.610
Sharat Chandra: The results are always going to be normal, or approximately normal.

811
01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:01.770
Sharat Chandra: Right.

812
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:14.430
Sharat Chandra: Now, if it is normal that means your status stick.

813
01:21:17.310 --> 01:21:23.100
Sharat Chandra: which we have to calculate is coming from some data, and we are seeing this data is normally distributed.

814
01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:26.640
Sharat Chandra: Okay, but there's continuous than it estimates.

815
01:21:27.810 --> 01:21:29.310
Sharat Chandra: That means it has certain properties.

816
01:21:30.450 --> 01:21:32.730
Sharat Chandra: As a variable is distributed normally with.

817
01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:35.340
Sharat Chandra: New and Sigma.

818
01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:39.750
Sharat Chandra: yeah.

819
01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:49.740
Sharat Chandra: So, considering these concepts, we are basically trying to make some studies here.

820
01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:58.530
Sharat Chandra: If I basically talk about first moment business decision, what is it talking about.

821
01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:05.190
Sharat Chandra: I mean it's nothing but me, but what does mean.

822
01:22:05.250 --> 01:22:06.030
Sharat Chandra: Speak above.

823
01:22:08.970 --> 01:22:09.330
Paramesh Putha: Average.

824
01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:13.620
Sharat Chandra: median or average and what does it.

825
01:22:14.190 --> 01:22:16.500
Rachana Kumbha: Distribution distribution.

826
01:22:18.330 --> 01:22:18.900
Sharat Chandra: mean.

827
01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:22.170
Rachana Kumbha: Okay variance is about distribution.

828
01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:28.020
Sharat Chandra: Yes, yeah I mean is the represent a to value or the characters.

829
01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:31.500
Sharat Chandra: Central tendency exactly.

830
01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:34.200
Sharat Chandra: So it is a representation or.

831
01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:35.940
characteristics.

832
01:22:37.890 --> 01:22:48.300
Sharat Chandra: Right and this data mean is representing about you, which gives some meaningful influence about your entire dataset.

833
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:52.260
Sharat Chandra: Thank okay so that's that's actually what meaning is all about.

834
01:22:54.990 --> 01:22:58.320
Sharat Chandra: Now, when we are trying to calculate population parameter.

835
01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:07.710
Sharat Chandra: we're trying to calculate population parameter, and these population parameters right is like your.

836
01:23:10.050 --> 01:23:12.480
Sharat Chandra: Fixed reserved for them and fixed pattern.

837
01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:21.330
Sharat Chandra: expected value, but when we are trying to calculate this we are getting status take.

838
01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:31.500
Sharat Chandra: And we get multiple statistics, but each of the statistic was done or calculated in order to get parameter.

839
01:23:32.970 --> 01:23:33.390
Sharat Chandra: Right.

840
01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:37.680
Sharat Chandra: So when we speak about.

841
01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:46.710
Sharat Chandra: Identifying the statistics, then we are saying that the value is coming from normally distributed data.

842
01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:50.820
Sharat Chandra: And normally distributed data is.

843
01:23:52.650 --> 01:23:54.000
Sharat Chandra: Having these two properties.

844
01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:56.250
Sharat Chandra: characteristics.

845
01:23:57.390 --> 01:24:10.920
Sharat Chandra: So mean is the representation so for all the possible statistics that we are talking about becomes your random variable now, and this random variable is trying to represent parameter.

846
01:24:12.630 --> 01:24:15.360
Sharat Chandra: Thank you, a sample data is trying to represent.

847
01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:20.760
Sharat Chandra: parameter, so we are looking at.

848
01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:23.160
Sharat Chandra: we're looking at.

849
01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:28.230
Sharat Chandra: Average of average years.

850
01:24:31.170 --> 01:24:33.930
Sharat Chandra: If you do this average of average yes.

851
01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:42.570
Sharat Chandra: This is X bar one this expert to this is expert three so on so forth right if we do average of average us.

852
01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:45.090
Sharat Chandra: This is your expired.

853
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:46.800
Sharat Chandra: Right.

854
01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:55.290
Sharat Chandra: Then we will get population average if I do average of whatever it is, I get new.

855
01:24:56.700 --> 01:25:01.170
Sharat Chandra: Because that's what this entire data is represented, we are interested in getting that only right.

856
01:25:03.450 --> 01:25:07.590
Sharat Chandra: So expired one X bar to so and so forth, if I tried to do that.

857
01:25:09.090 --> 01:25:11.220
Sharat Chandra: Again opposition.

858
01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:18.300
Sharat Chandra: This is the specific property that we have to remember, and this is what central limit theorem is speaking.

859
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:24.330
Sharat Chandra: mean off means.

860
01:25:25.530 --> 01:25:31.170
Sharat Chandra: This is X bar mean off these expires is basically giving us population mean view.

861
01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:34.650
Sharat Chandra: At the same time standard deviation.

862
01:25:36.810 --> 01:25:42.300
Sharat Chandra: is basically nothing but Sigma by square root of its various basically Sigma squared y en.

863
01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:48.390
Sharat Chandra: Therefore calculations views that ugly variance.

864
01:25:49.530 --> 01:25:54.810
Sharat Chandra: Others, otherwise we cannot deal with the red different summation it becomes a zero.

865
01:26:00.090 --> 01:26:01.380
Sharat Chandra: Right so standard deviation.

866
01:26:02.430 --> 01:26:09.540
Sharat Chandra: X equals two Sigma squared Rudolph and which is the variation in these samples with respect to the Center.

867
01:26:11.610 --> 01:26:15.150
Sharat Chandra: So if I consider this a sample data and then variable.

868
01:26:17.190 --> 01:26:30.750
Sharat Chandra: Then first moment, which is the mean is going to be the mean of these results second moment is the variation among these samples, that is, can split that is calculated by square root of.

869
01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:36.660
Sharat Chandra: Right, so this is basically be.

870
01:26:38.850 --> 01:26:41.790
Sharat Chandra: Calculations for your random variable.

871
01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:45.810
Sharat Chandra: That random variable is nothing but the statistic.

872
01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:50.160
Sharat Chandra: Okay, the big days status it.

873
01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:54.150
Sharat Chandra: Is it making sense for you want.

874
01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:00.600
Sharat Chandra: Any questions, yes.

875
01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:06.450
Sharat Chandra: yeah any questions anyone.

876
01:27:12.450 --> 01:27:15.090
Sharat Chandra: i'm assuming everybody's aware it's understood.

877
01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:20.790
Sharat Chandra: So central limit theorem okay this theater.

878
01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:36.360
Sharat Chandra: is basically coming to a conclusion, saying that the distribution of the sample statistic right the distribution of sample statistics will be not.

879
01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:47.580
Sharat Chandra: Irrespective of whether the data that we are getting the population data that we're getting is normal or not.

880
01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:50.250
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

881
01:27:52.020 --> 01:28:01.170
Sharat Chandra: So that's basically your central limit theorem and the calculations for the random data that we're talking about is this first moment and second moment.

882
01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:10.860
Sharat Chandra: The second moment is also Congress standard error of me, because we are trying to calculate menier so we sent a standard deviation of me.

883
01:28:15.630 --> 01:28:17.850
Sharat Chandra: is nothing but the difference.

884
01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:21.930
Sharat Chandra: Here, that we are speaking about is the.

885
01:28:23.190 --> 01:28:23.850
Sharat Chandra: difference.

886
01:28:25.950 --> 01:28:29.010
Sharat Chandra: Okay, on an average, what is the edit that descended.

887
01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:45.660
Sharat Chandra: yeah now standard error is nothing but standard deviation on Defense is just that in standard deviation they are looking at individual data.

888
01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:53.610
Sharat Chandra: Basically, looking at X one X two X three so on so forth.

889
01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:00.240
Sharat Chandra: Whereas standard error is the average.

890
01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:03.030
Sharat Chandra: That we have calculated.

891
01:29:04.650 --> 01:29:14.460
Sharat Chandra: This is the red sample me so standard error is talking about variation in these means sample means with respect to.

892
01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:25.140
Sharat Chandra: very, very important central limit theorem studied try to digest it by how to remember it.

893
01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:27.750
Sharat Chandra: Great it's just like to table.

894
01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:29.460
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

895
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:35.040
Sharat Chandra: Okay now.

896
01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:45.060
Sharat Chandra: Using this concept will try to implement a logic try to implement concept on not doing inferential statistics.

897
01:29:46.830 --> 01:29:47.220
Sharat Chandra: No.

898
01:29:48.570 --> 01:29:49.380
Sharat Chandra: yeah before that.

899
01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:56.730
Sharat Chandra: What does the probability of today's temperature being 20 degrees.

900
01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:01.740
Sharat Chandra: it's coordinates, at least in hyderabad it is cold.

901
01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:09.300
Sharat Chandra: So if I say to this temperature is 20 degrees, because it is continuous the probabilities equal to zero right.

902
01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:19.020
Sharat Chandra: right because it's a continuous skin temperature is a continuous to finding exactly one value.

903
01:30:21.090 --> 01:30:23.760
Sharat Chandra: Which is 20 degrees is zero.

904
01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:26.910
Sharat Chandra: Right.

905
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:37.980
Sharat Chandra: So how about taking a range, which is minus 5200.

906
01:30:39.090 --> 01:30:45.150
Sharat Chandra: So what what we are basically saying is if this is your continuous access temperature could be.

907
01:30:46.710 --> 01:30:47.760
Sharat Chandra: 20 degrees.

908
01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:51.870
Sharat Chandra: The same temperature could be 20 degrees.

909
01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:54.750
Sharat Chandra: yeah.

910
01:30:58.530 --> 01:31:00.030
Sharat Chandra: If it is 20 degrees.

911
01:31:01.170 --> 01:31:04.020
Sharat Chandra: Then getting exactly that value is zero.

912
01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:05.580
Sharat Chandra: But.

913
01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:12.900
Sharat Chandra: I can say that the temperature could be minus 50 degrees 200 degrees.

914
01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:14.970
Sharat Chandra: Right.

915
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:23.070
Sharat Chandra: Can can be temperature tomorrow be between minus 50 degrees 200 degrees.

916
01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:33.090
Sharat Chandra: yeah.

917
01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:40.050
Rachana Kumbha: Mobility still be zero, and I said, because it is a continuous can we cannot actually 10 that.

918
01:31:41.070 --> 01:31:45.630
Sharat Chandra: No, no, no that's what we calculated la area under the curve, it is not.

919
01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:49.500
Rachana Kumbha: Okay okay Okay, so you had a another call concept comes up.

920
01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:53.640
Sharat Chandra: Exactly by by because i'm saying minus 5200 degrees.

921
01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:54.750
Rachana Kumbha: Right okay.

922
01:31:55.020 --> 01:32:10.590
Rachana Kumbha: So whenever there's a particular interval only then we can actually use this formula it's like because previously, you have just given up what are they going to value right like if it is about six at that we can qualify them for the exam so.

923
01:32:12.210 --> 01:32:12.750
Sharat Chandra: When you say.

924
01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:18.360
Sharat Chandra: about six add we were basically talking about the range, which is extended to succeed.

925
01:32:18.990 --> 01:32:19.650
Rachana Kumbha: Okay okay.

926
01:32:20.190 --> 01:32:23.190
Sharat Chandra: Oh, there is a range here so area comes into picture.

927
01:32:23.670 --> 01:32:29.040
Sharat Chandra: Okay what's the least value will be take OK OK.

928
01:32:29.070 --> 01:32:33.900
Rachana Kumbha: So it's like wherever only if there's a range specified, only then we can use this particular.

929
01:32:34.170 --> 01:32:35.910
Sharat Chandra: Otherwise, you can discover this.

930
01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:38.610
Sharat Chandra: Know whenever there is a continuous data.

931
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.960
Rachana Kumbha: Okay okay.

932
01:32:40.530 --> 01:32:47.400
Sharat Chandra: Then we look into this range calibration if it is discrete I know that there are probably fixed value.

933
01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:57.330
Rachana Kumbha: Yes, yes, so it's like if they give like on your particular value like you know what is the probability of temperature being 20 degrees then it's like obviously zero but.

934
01:32:57.630 --> 01:33:04.110
Rachana Kumbha: Like when they give a range anywhere if there's a continuous data and there's a range, we can estimate it using confidence interval.

935
01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:07.830
Sharat Chandra: hey yes area under the gun.

936
01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:09.210
Rachana Kumbha: Yes, yes.

937
01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:11.280
Sharat Chandra: But.

938
01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:19.920
Sharat Chandra: Should I say minus 50 degrees 200 degrees tomorrow's temperature can be anywhere between minus 50 degrees 200 things.

939
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:21.660
Sharat Chandra: Can I say that.

940
01:33:23.670 --> 01:33:25.890
Rachana Kumbha: It is still difficult to estimate monster.

941
01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:36.210
Sharat Chandra: But that is the estimation and telling cheatham you're asking me what was the temperature going to be like, so I am saying that tomorrow it will be between minus 50 degrees 200 tickets.

942
01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:44.430
Sharat Chandra: anyways anywhere in that range, whatever the value that might be, it will be there between minus 50 degrees 200.

943
01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:54.600
Rachana Kumbha: Okay, because it is temperature like a via because, obviously, like the temperature may not be like soul, or so high, but.

944
01:33:55.050 --> 01:34:08.970
Rachana Kumbha: it's like if suppose it when you consider the concept of Marks like let's take on demand, so you trade if we can make, even if you say that you may score between at 200 marks also the probability maybe zero like I may not.

945
01:34:09.450 --> 01:34:10.260
Sharat Chandra: Maybe 200.

946
01:34:10.350 --> 01:34:20.970
Sharat Chandra: OK, so my question is now giving the example of marks, I want to predict what marks been stretched now score if I conduct an exam yes.

947
01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:25.170
Sharat Chandra: So I can say she can score anywhere between 02 hundred.

948
01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:30.690
Rachana Kumbha: or 500 is a maximum and zero, and it is obviously between 02.

949
01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:32.430
Rachana Kumbha: yeah so.

950
01:34:32.490 --> 01:34:33.480
Sharat Chandra: i'm trying to predict.

951
01:34:34.170 --> 01:34:41.520
Sharat Chandra: Okay okay you're asking me to predict MC rationale can score marks anywhere between 02 hundred degrees so 100 bucks.

952
01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:49.200
Rachana Kumbha: Okay, what is difficult, like like you cannot say that 60 to 80 or 8200, then that will like still the probability will be zero in that case even.

953
01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:56.580
Sharat Chandra: During exactly, but my question again understand the question my question you see you're interested in learning.

954
01:34:57.630 --> 01:35:10.650
Sharat Chandra: You are asking me that if I write an exam now right i'm not sure, no, no i'm asking up but i'm saying that hey tomorrow, I have an exam, can you tell me well how much would I score.

955
01:35:13.470 --> 01:35:20.880
Sharat Chandra: Then, so what is that you're interested in, are you interested in telling me, I mean hearing that the answer could be anywhere between 02 hundred months.

956
01:35:21.270 --> 01:35:25.980
Sharat Chandra: know that is obvious right, you also know it, why do you need to ask anyone.

957
01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:27.420
Yes.

958
01:35:28.710 --> 01:35:45.060
Sharat Chandra: But then when you are asking this you want to get a precise value probably want to hear exact marks at marks you're going to get at marks for sure you want to listen, this number but probability of that single number is always zero if data is continuous.

959
01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:47.700
Rachana Kumbha: Yes, yes okay.

960
01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:51.600
Sharat Chandra: So you cannot give a single number.

961
01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:52.680
Rachana Kumbha: Okay.

962
01:35:52.710 --> 01:35:56.280
Sharat Chandra: The same time I cannot give the complete range.

963
01:35:58.140 --> 01:35:58.770
Rachana Kumbha: Okay.

964
01:35:59.550 --> 01:36:07.140
Sharat Chandra: right if I say if my my day town lies between zero to one okay my total data lies between 02 right okay.

965
01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:09.960
Sharat Chandra: So, if this is my range.

966
01:36:11.130 --> 01:36:14.610
Sharat Chandra: What will be the area under the curve for this rich.

967
01:36:17.010 --> 01:36:17.670
Okay.

968
01:36:19.590 --> 01:36:20.940
Sharat Chandra: If you under the covers how much.

969
01:36:21.390 --> 01:36:21.840
Rachana Kumbha: one.

970
01:36:21.930 --> 01:36:25.950
Sharat Chandra: Between the 100% obviously I know.

971
01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:32.310
Sharat Chandra: Yes, that record is going to score marks between 02 hundred that is for sure hundred percent.

972
01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:33.480
Rachana Kumbha: He is.

973
01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:41.730
Sharat Chandra: Right, but I want to listen to more practically acceptable results.

974
01:36:42.750 --> 01:36:43.770
Sharat Chandra: So maybe.

975
01:36:43.950 --> 01:36:56.220
Sharat Chandra: I want, if i'm reading I want to hear that the Max could be somewhere between 70 to 80 or 80 to 90 or whatever, that is.

976
01:36:58.860 --> 01:37:01.140
Sharat Chandra: This portion is what you will be interested in.

977
01:37:01.710 --> 01:37:02.760
Yes, yes.

978
01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:06.510
Sharat Chandra: So the chance that you have.

979
01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:11.430
Sharat Chandra: Right to get marks should lie in this range.

980
01:37:12.450 --> 01:37:12.930
Okay.

981
01:37:14.130 --> 01:37:15.960
Rachana Kumbha: Okay, I get it so.

982
01:37:16.350 --> 01:37:24.570
Sharat Chandra: The prediction that I am doing to you cannot be having such a wide range, because there is no point doing prediction is that.

983
01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:27.660
Sharat Chandra: it's covering the entire range.

984
01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:31.950
Rachana Kumbha: Yes, yes, so that was my question like minus on it like.

985
01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:35.610
Rachana Kumbha: Obviously, the maximum we between 02 hundred right.

986
01:37:36.540 --> 01:37:45.060
Sharat Chandra: yeah exactly that that's where i'm coming right, so the the prediction that you're trying to do, should be more closer.

987
01:37:45.090 --> 01:37:46.320
Sharat Chandra: To the actual that you.

988
01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:47.070
Sharat Chandra: That means.

989
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:51.030
Sharat Chandra: That means that you're speaking about should reduce.

990
01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:57.900
Sharat Chandra: Okay, the rain should reduce it should get closer and closer to the single value per parameter.

991
01:37:59.790 --> 01:38:00.330
Sharat Chandra: But now.

992
01:38:01.530 --> 01:38:02.340
Sharat Chandra: If I say.

993
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:07.020
Sharat Chandra: that's not has a chance of scoring anywhere from 30 to.

994
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:08.670
Sharat Chandra: 90.

995
01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:12.780
Sharat Chandra: i'm doing the prediction okay.

996
01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:20.820
Sharat Chandra: i'm saying that don't worry about right the exam you'll have a chance of scoring marks between 30 to 90.

997
01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:23.250
Sharat Chandra: Compared to.

998
01:38:24.630 --> 01:38:28.950
Sharat Chandra: i'm saying that you have a chance of scoring somewhere from night 75 to 90.

999
01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:33.450
Sharat Chandra: When I am trying to do the prediction.

1000
01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:36.720
Sharat Chandra: or let's say you are doing the prediction to me.

1001
01:38:38.130 --> 01:38:42.630
Sharat Chandra: Okay i'm asking you the question and you're coming up with the predictions.

1002
01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:47.010
Sharat Chandra: option one is this option two is this.

1003
01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:50.610
Sharat Chandra: In each of these two cases.

1004
01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:53.430
Sharat Chandra: You have more confidence.

1005
01:38:54.930 --> 01:38:55.500
Sharat Chandra: That when you.

1006
01:38:55.590 --> 01:39:00.510
Rachana Kumbha: have been different because it's only a range of 20 right so at least range, it has.

1007
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:06.150
Rachana Kumbha: Like that's a more precise answer if you're looking for a precise answer.

1008
01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:09.360
Sharat Chandra: But what does the chance that you're going to be correct.

1009
01:39:10.110 --> 01:39:13.500
Rachana Kumbha: The chance is very less chances with that because.

1010
01:39:13.770 --> 01:39:15.540
Sharat Chandra: Your confidence is will come down a.

1011
01:39:15.690 --> 01:39:17.250
Rachana Kumbha: Yes, definitely yes, yes.

1012
01:39:17.370 --> 01:39:24.000
Sharat Chandra: So Mike what my question was your confidence when you are trying to tell these results to your clients.

1013
01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:26.700
Rachana Kumbha: well.

1014
01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:29.670
Sharat Chandra: Your confidence also reduces with the range.

1015
01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:33.090
Rachana Kumbha: Okay.

1016
01:39:34.290 --> 01:39:35.550
Sharat Chandra: Right yes.

1017
01:39:36.690 --> 01:39:49.290
Sharat Chandra: So you cannot be giving a full range wide range, at the same time, you cannot be giving a range, which is too short, where your confidence is going.

1018
01:39:49.290 --> 01:39:49.620
Rachana Kumbha: To come.

1019
01:39:52.170 --> 01:39:52.620
Okay.

1020
01:39:53.790 --> 01:39:54.150
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1021
01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:57.690
Sharat Chandra: So you need to have.

1022
01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:01.500
Sharat Chandra: A balanced approach.

1023
01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:02.970
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

1024
01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:06.060
Sharat Chandra: This calculations.

1025
01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:06.690
Rachana Kumbha: That we're trying to.

1026
01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:11.700
Sharat Chandra: Look at is called as confidence interval because you're giving some interval.

1027
01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:17.100
Sharat Chandra: And that interval should also be having some confidence associated with it.

1028
01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:24.030
Sharat Chandra: So tomorrow's temperature could be 20 degrees to 40 degrees 10 degrees to 15 weeks.

1029
01:40:26.910 --> 01:40:29.340
Sharat Chandra: Confidence in this result will be more.

1030
01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:39.510
Sharat Chandra: Your confidence when you are predicting the results in wider range will be more because the chance of the actual value falling in this range is more.

1031
01:40:41.130 --> 01:40:47.100
Sharat Chandra: isn't it if this is the area under the bell curve i'm trying bell curve, because these are continuous values that were speaking about.

1032
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:52.140
Sharat Chandra: Right alright, so this is continuous one yo.

1033
01:40:53.670 --> 01:40:56.310
Sharat Chandra: If I see 20 degrees to 40 degrees.

1034
01:40:58.050 --> 01:41:01.890
Sharat Chandra: Then tomorrow's temperature actually being in this range.

1035
01:41:04.110 --> 01:41:08.940
Sharat Chandra: will be less right probability associated with this range is less.

1036
01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:09.780
Yes.

1037
01:41:11.190 --> 01:41:18.750
Sharat Chandra: But if I say 10 degrees to 50 degrees, the probability of the value falling in this range increases.

1038
01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:23.910
Sharat Chandra: So that means the prediction that i'm doing has more chance of being correct.

1039
01:41:26.910 --> 01:41:28.830
Sharat Chandra: Right, hence it scholars confidence interval.

1040
01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:37.050
Sharat Chandra: So let us see how how to actually do the calculation and how do we actually interpret this.

1041
01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:46.050
Sharat Chandra: So a bank with hundred thousand customers.

1042
01:41:47.490 --> 01:41:52.440
Sharat Chandra: There is a bank financial institution, and it has hundred thousand customers.

1043
01:41:55.260 --> 01:41:56.340
Sharat Chandra: And they're offering.

1044
01:41:57.750 --> 01:42:01.860
Sharat Chandra: That thinking to offer credit card to its customers.

1045
01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:06.690
Sharat Chandra: Okay they're planning to give credit cards.

1046
01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:11.850
Sharat Chandra: But giving credit card means there is a lot of investment also involved isn't it.

1047
01:42:16.770 --> 01:42:28.440
Sharat Chandra: And the any business right in this case, credit card business the profitability of this option or this business opportunity is going to be.

1048
01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:40.050
Sharat Chandra: Depending on what is the total balance that the customers are maintaining because credit cards, if you talk about credits credits are given.

1049
01:42:42.810 --> 01:42:48.990
Sharat Chandra: That, if you have money, it has a bank if Bank does not have money, how can it give credits.

1050
01:42:51.450 --> 01:42:58.110
Sharat Chandra: How does bank to get money by the savings account by the deposits.

1051
01:42:59.970 --> 01:43:08.760
Sharat Chandra: that the individual customers are aggregated all the result will be the capital investment for being the giving the credit cards or credit systems.

1052
01:43:10.230 --> 01:43:12.570
Sharat Chandra: So profitability of the card.

1053
01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:16.050
Sharat Chandra: will depend on how much money.

1054
01:43:17.550 --> 01:43:25.980
Sharat Chandra: Does that bank has that money is based on the average balance that the card holders are make the customers are Nick.

1055
01:43:28.830 --> 01:43:29.130
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1056
01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:42.030
Sharat Chandra: Know should I go ahead and launch the credit card design business head and deciding to come up with this option should I directly launched the credit card land for everybody.

1057
01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:50.970
Paramesh Putha: What hadn't been blessed yeah not every.

1058
01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:59.730
Sharat Chandra: Now, we should not blindly invest in any business, not just credit card business any business idea, you have should you directly jump in invest money.

1059
01:44:00.930 --> 01:44:07.320
Sharat Chandra: Or do you do preliminary analysis, research on whether the idea will work or.

1060
01:44:11.670 --> 01:44:13.650
Rachana Kumbha: Definitely will do research before.

1061
01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:16.230
Rachana Kumbha: Implementing anything.

1062
01:44:16.890 --> 01:44:20.580
Sharat Chandra: Exactly hey so any investment that you have to do you have to be careful.

1063
01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:27.420
Sharat Chandra: So blindly investing and then assessing whether it will work or not is a foolish decision, you should not be doing that.

1064
01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:32.250
Sharat Chandra: What if it doesn't work all your investment is gone for us isn't it.

1065
01:44:33.510 --> 01:44:36.000
Sharat Chandra: So you're going to look out for.

1066
01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:40.110
Sharat Chandra: The option on should I invest.

1067
01:44:41.130 --> 01:44:49.920
Sharat Chandra: For that, first, you need to do an assessment of the idea here the credit card launches an idea and we are trying to research assistant.

1068
01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:56.430
Sharat Chandra: To do that, we are trying to do a pilot lunch.

1069
01:44:57.540 --> 01:44:59.580
Sharat Chandra: We generally do pilot lunches.

1070
01:45:01.710 --> 01:45:08.610
Sharat Chandra: Much market research campaign is launched, and then we using that right credit Karma banks set up these.

1071
01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:12.360
Sharat Chandra: cans, the temporary.

1072
01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:23.610
Sharat Chandra: What do you want the stalls and they try to read give pamphlets and try to ask customers about different things, and all that so on the similar lines, a market campaigns run.

1073
01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:28.530
Sharat Chandra: And people who are interested, for them, these credit cards will keep.

1074
01:45:30.570 --> 01:45:33.870
Sharat Chandra: So 140 customers accept the car.

1075
01:45:35.250 --> 01:45:45.240
Sharat Chandra: right when they were launching in the marketing campaign probably 500 different customers came up, but only 140 customers accepted among all the customers that back.

1076
01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:56.190
Sharat Chandra: Okay, so this becomes your pilot launch you're given this credit card to their customers and whenever you have credit card.

1077
01:45:57.660 --> 01:45:58.020
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1078
01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:05.190
Sharat Chandra: If you invest in current if you have a credit card, we always try to use the credit card.

1079
01:46:07.620 --> 01:46:11.550
Sharat Chandra: right we don't directly use our bank account.

1080
01:46:12.810 --> 01:46:14.400
Sharat Chandra: Savings account debit cards.

1081
01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:17.490
Sharat Chandra: Right, we will use credit cards.

1082
01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:21.510
Sharat Chandra: So that means the average balance.

1083
01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:24.480
Sharat Chandra: That we maintain will be a little higher.

1084
01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:28.980
Sharat Chandra: Right, so we are trying to see.

1085
01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:32.340
Sharat Chandra: What is the average balance.

1086
01:46:33.690 --> 01:46:47.160
Sharat Chandra: That the customers these 140 customers are going to maintain because profitability is directly proportionate to the balance that right so market research campaign is launched in which about 140 customers accept the card as a pilot.

1087
01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:54.180
Sharat Chandra: Now, when we invested this.

1088
01:46:55.230 --> 01:47:03.720
Sharat Chandra: date when we invested the on on these campaign launch the idea is to gather the data and then assess this is your sample.

1089
01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:09.780
Sharat Chandra: They were doing inferential statistics here, this is sample.

1090
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:13.860
Sharat Chandra: But as this is your population.

1091
01:47:15.210 --> 01:47:15.540
Sharat Chandra: OK.

1092
01:47:20.340 --> 01:47:31.770
Sharat Chandra: So the data that we gathered is like the average balance maintained by these 140 is 90 $90 the standard deviation so much and we're also saying assume the population standard is so.

1093
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:36.360
Sharat Chandra: Now, given the sample data.

1094
01:47:38.010 --> 01:47:48.960
Sharat Chandra: We have to identify how much would be the average balance if the card is given to all the customers hundred thousand customers, what will be the average fan.

1095
01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:54.660
Sharat Chandra: Okay let's let's see what what all things we have and what is that would be to calibrate.

1096
01:47:56.490 --> 01:48:03.030
Sharat Chandra: So i'm writing the notation yes symbols hundred thousand is your population size.

1097
01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:06.810
Sharat Chandra: sample size is one for.

1098
01:48:09.210 --> 01:48:17.850
Sharat Chandra: Right now, this 19 $90 that we are looking at is actually represented as X bar.

1099
01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:19.860
Sharat Chandra: This is X bar.

1100
01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:31.680
Sharat Chandra: Right, because they are talking about these 140 customers it's a sample data right so expert then $2,833.

1101
01:48:33.390 --> 01:48:37.350
Sharat Chandra: This is represented as smallest standard deviation of the sampling.

1102
01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:43.770
Sharat Chandra: assume that the population standard deviation population standard deviation is Sigma.

1103
01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:47.700
Sharat Chandra: assume that the population standard deviation is.

1104
01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:50.520
Sharat Chandra: 2005 that done.

1105
01:48:53.070 --> 01:49:01.500
Sharat Chandra: So these values are given to us and we say what can we say about average balance that will be held after a full fledged market.

1106
01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:12.480
Sharat Chandra: That meets this is the full fledge market lunch, what will be the average balance for this, so it is population parameter, and this is what we need to identify.

1107
01:49:17.790 --> 01:49:18.630
Sharat Chandra: What is our view.

1108
01:49:20.970 --> 01:49:21.240
Sharat Chandra: yeah.

1109
01:49:34.350 --> 01:49:35.580
Sharat Chandra: Difference what will be the mean.

1110
01:49:41.310 --> 01:49:42.000
Sharat Chandra: Should I say.

1111
01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:44.430
Sharat Chandra: it's been inferential statistics.

1112
01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:45.900
Paramesh Putha: We will be.

1113
01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.800
Paramesh Putha: Like we should know like Mina.

1114
01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:54.150
Paramesh Putha: And to be liked by Mr Sam more than.

1115
01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:56.100
Paramesh Putha: Later yeah.

1116
01:49:58.830 --> 01:49:59.400
Okay.

1117
01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:05.550
Sharat Chandra: So, are you saying that we will be doing multiple market lunches.

1118
01:50:09.150 --> 01:50:15.600
Paramesh Putha: Like at least, we need the data like only one samples me, maybe I think we cannot get the population.

1119
01:50:16.110 --> 01:50:19.170
Sharat Chandra: No, no, no, no, you will be always working with one sample only.

1120
01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:26.190
Sharat Chandra: See practically do you want to launch this multiple times.

1121
01:50:26.340 --> 01:50:27.120
Sharat Chandra: know you.

1122
01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:29.910
Sharat Chandra: Basically, you want more data.

1123
01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:36.870
Sharat Chandra: yeah but you cannot just doing this, you cannot just keep doing this and not take a business decision.

1124
01:50:38.700 --> 01:50:42.210
Sharat Chandra: Any scenario, you will only be working with single sample next.

1125
01:50:46.770 --> 01:50:47.730
Sharat Chandra: yeah so let me.

1126
01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:49.110
Paramesh Putha: Talk about this now.

1127
01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:52.680
Sharat Chandra: See we're talking about central limit theorem.

1128
01:50:54.030 --> 01:50:55.950
Sharat Chandra: Central limit theorem says that.

1129
01:50:57.210 --> 01:51:05.220
Sharat Chandra: The statistic value that we are get actually doing the calculation for a price calculation is a.

1130
01:51:06.930 --> 01:51:09.540
Sharat Chandra: Continuous value the statistic.

1131
01:51:11.490 --> 01:51:20.190
Sharat Chandra: is always a continuous map and if it is continuous, it will be normally distributed and if it is normally distributed a certain properties.

1132
01:51:23.610 --> 01:51:23.970
Okay.

1133
01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:31.350
Sharat Chandra: And we are interested in finding out a single value of this normally distributed data.

1134
01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:48.690
Sharat Chandra: But when I tried to do this in the value calculation, it will be zero property would be zero right hands, we take range, but if I take range, I cannot take the full range I have we appreciate you taking the rich, these are the discussions that we have right.

1135
01:51:50.850 --> 01:51:53.550
Sharat Chandra: Now let me ask you a very simple question okay.

1136
01:51:54.600 --> 01:52:02.040
Sharat Chandra: you're you're traveling to offices right probably you have started traveling to offices Now the question is how much time.

1137
01:52:03.150 --> 01:52:06.300
Sharat Chandra: Will you take to travel in.

1138
01:52:09.270 --> 01:52:11.370
Sharat Chandra: Time to travel from.

1139
01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:14.760
Sharat Chandra: Your home to office.

1140
01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:19.110
Sharat Chandra: yeah but, what is your answer is.

1141
01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:29.220
Paramesh Putha: going to be in some ways, like 20 minutes to 30 minutes, if not the participants depending on.

1142
01:52:30.810 --> 01:52:35.040
Sharat Chandra: Depending on that traffic so you're saying 20 to 30 okay.

1143
01:52:37.470 --> 01:52:38.100
Sharat Chandra: yeah there's.

1144
01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:40.620
Sharat Chandra: Everybody will.

1145
01:52:40.650 --> 01:52:41.790
Paramesh Putha: might want to write.

1146
01:52:42.210 --> 01:52:43.920
Sharat Chandra: share your answer.

1147
01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:53.400
Rachana Kumbha: It also depends on a mode of travel right like if you're going by metro and probably take less time away.

1148
01:52:53.460 --> 01:52:54.330
Sharat Chandra: Whatever it is.

1149
01:52:54.420 --> 01:53:00.300
Sharat Chandra: i'm not worried about all that i'm just asking you to tell me what is the time travel that you basically.

1150
01:53:00.330 --> 01:53:06.840
Rachana Kumbha: It would be an arranger Nice are obviously so 40 minutes to 60 minutes 40 minutes to 60.

1151
01:53:07.470 --> 01:53:09.750
Sharat Chandra: Okay you're saying 40 to 60 okay.

1152
01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:14.820
Sharat Chandra: Assuming you're traveling only by one mode of transport.

1153
01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:15.660
Sharat Chandra: The respect to whatever.

1154
01:53:18.690 --> 01:53:20.340
Sharat Chandra: Oh, my number two one enough or.

1155
01:53:25.260 --> 01:53:26.850
Sharat Chandra: If I have to convert that you two.

1156
01:53:27.990 --> 01:53:32.580
Sharat Chandra: minutes, then I would probably say 60 minutes to 90 minutes.

1157
01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:37.830
Sharat Chandra: That do you do 40 somebody saying 30 to 40 Okay, my question to you all.

1158
01:53:40.830 --> 01:53:52.350
Sharat Chandra: Right 60 to 90 minutes or why 20 to 30 minutes or white 30 to 40 or 40 to 60 days for in your respective cases, why not this 25 to.

1159
01:53:53.550 --> 01:53:53.940
30.

1160
01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:55.980
Sharat Chandra: like this.

1161
01:53:57.060 --> 01:53:57.420
Rachana Kumbha: With.

1162
01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:07.410
Sharat Chandra: 10 to nine, irrespective of the case i'm talking about let's say, if you are cases in your office or home or fixed distances right I don't think it will change.

1163
01:54:07.620 --> 01:54:10.020
Rachana Kumbha: The word for permission has different distance, for me it is.

1164
01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:14.250
Sharat Chandra: done i'm not talking more pernicious i'm talking only about your case you said 20 to 30.

1165
01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:18.540
Sharat Chandra: So, for your case i'm asking why 20 to 30 is.

1166
01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:24.000
Sharat Chandra: Your answer, why not 10 to 14 or why not 25 to 30.

1167
01:54:25.890 --> 01:54:27.840
Sharat Chandra: Why do you do take 10 minutes interval.

1168
01:54:29.550 --> 01:54:31.800
Sharat Chandra: Why not 30 minute interval or why not five minutes.

1169
01:54:33.780 --> 01:54:43.170
Rachana Kumbha: minimum and maximum time like I would have ever taken the least amount of ever taken to travel, what is 20 minutes in the maximum time I would have taken in wants to travel with is 13.

1170
01:54:43.650 --> 01:54:44.040
Sharat Chandra: Now, how.

1171
01:54:44.490 --> 01:54:45.570
Sharat Chandra: Are you conclusion that.

1172
01:54:45.630 --> 01:54:47.340
Sharat Chandra: My question is, how are you, including.

1173
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:58.860
Sharat Chandra: Are you sure, basically, whatever the title travel time that you had to know the experience that till now is your sample data.

1174
01:54:59.340 --> 01:54:59.940
Rachana Kumbha: Yes, yes.

1175
01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.690
Sharat Chandra: Are you sure you're going not going beyond 30 minutes in future.

1176
01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:06.450
Sharat Chandra: populations.

1177
01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:12.360
Rachana Kumbha: We can see this more probability of the time being, between 20 to 30 minutes what.

1178
01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:13.170
Sharat Chandra: Is that is a.

1179
01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:15.990
Sharat Chandra: yeah what is what up there is an accident on the road.

1180
01:55:17.190 --> 01:55:17.580
Rachana Kumbha: yeah.

1181
01:55:18.810 --> 01:55:19.200
Rachana Kumbha: Yes.

1182
01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:21.240
Rachana Kumbha: Then it will vary.

1183
01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:26.400
Sharat Chandra: Yes, sample data from your past experiences only they're talking about all.

1184
01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:29.190
Sharat Chandra: This, but I want to also consider the.

1185
01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:33.960
Sharat Chandra: confidence that that you are coming up with this scenario.

1186
01:55:35.370 --> 01:55:35.670
Right.

1187
01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:41.730
Sharat Chandra: If you say 25 to 30 minutes, maybe.

1188
01:55:42.780 --> 01:55:48.870
Sharat Chandra: There are there will be cases where you're going to reach beyond I mean you're going to take beyond 20 minutes sorry.

1189
01:55:49.980 --> 01:55:50.730
Sharat Chandra: 30 minutes.

1190
01:55:51.150 --> 01:55:52.620
Sharat Chandra: Sorry, my office.

1191
01:55:53.400 --> 01:56:02.190
Rachana Kumbha: Several guys, he said, the as the rage increases, then the confidence levels also increased when the range is smaller than the confidence levels also will be lesser right.

1192
01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:06.780
Sharat Chandra: yeah that's what i'm trying to explain, yes, if I see 25 to 30 million you.

1193
01:56:06.780 --> 01:56:08.790
Sharat Chandra: can say 25 to 30 minutes.

1194
01:56:09.420 --> 01:56:13.470
Sharat Chandra: There are chances where you might reach office, the late.

1195
01:56:14.910 --> 01:56:21.960
Sharat Chandra: More than 30 minutes are there might be cases where you're going to reach office early before 25 minutes.

1196
01:56:24.090 --> 01:56:28.230
Sharat Chandra: Right so chance of going wrong will increase.

1197
01:56:30.810 --> 01:56:33.750
Sharat Chandra: Right, whereas here the chance of going wrong is less.

1198
01:56:35.910 --> 01:56:38.550
Sharat Chandra: Compared to this, the chance of going wrong is less here right.

1199
01:56:42.330 --> 01:56:51.300
Sharat Chandra: So whatever we are we're basically talking about it, so if you're saying 20 to 30 minutes, I mean i'm only talking about one example Okay, you said 20 to 30.

1200
01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:58.320
Sharat Chandra: This could be 25 and we basically just 25 plus or minus five.

1201
01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:01.980
Sharat Chandra: Right hey.

1202
01:57:03.390 --> 01:57:06.870
Sharat Chandra: it's in the first place, why 20 to 30, why not some other than.

1203
01:57:08.370 --> 01:57:10.410
Sharat Chandra: This is because of your.

1204
01:57:11.670 --> 01:57:13.560
Sharat Chandra: Experience sample data.

1205
01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.220
Sharat Chandra: And this is with respect to your Conference.

1206
01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:22.860
Sharat Chandra: If you want to be more conflict say i'm your manager and if i'm asking you this question.

1207
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:35.550
Sharat Chandra: Right, you need to give more chance to yourself, so that you reach that office begin the time right, so in that case you probably say 10 minutes.

1208
01:57:38.700 --> 01:57:42.330
Sharat Chandra: Right, because the scope that you are getting now will increase.

1209
01:57:43.770 --> 01:57:59.100
Sharat Chandra: She will be more confident when you are representing this number isn't it, she will say 15 minutes to 35 minutes, whereas if you say 25 plus or minus five minutes, that means you're only given 20 minutes 30 minutes range for yourself.

1210
01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:02.160
Rachana Kumbha: Okay.

1211
01:58:04.740 --> 01:58:04.950
Sharat Chandra: yeah.

1212
01:58:04.980 --> 01:58:06.120
Everyone making sense right.

1213
01:58:18.030 --> 01:58:18.540
Sharat Chandra: Yes.

1214
01:58:19.590 --> 01:58:20.340
Sharat Chandra: it's making sense of.

1215
01:58:29.190 --> 01:58:30.060
Paramesh Putha: confidence.

1216
01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:32.820
Sharat Chandra: 30 confidence.

1217
01:58:33.330 --> 01:58:37.710
Paramesh Putha: That, if the range is more like ranges more white than on the ball.

1218
01:58:38.190 --> 01:58:42.930
Sharat Chandra: Obviously, yes, because the chance of your value falling in that range increases.

1219
01:58:46.680 --> 01:58:55.770
Rachana Kumbha: That, but if they go the minimum and maximum mistaken I Canna marks case you have begun like 02 hundred then there it's be like hundred percent confidence if the complete range is taken.

1220
01:58:56.280 --> 01:58:57.630
Rachana Kumbha: Yes, yeah.

1221
01:58:58.230 --> 01:59:05.220
Sharat Chandra: So there is no chance you're going wrong, say, the actual value can live between this marks.

1222
01:59:07.740 --> 01:59:08.100
Yes.

1223
01:59:09.150 --> 01:59:09.750
Sharat Chandra: So there is.

1224
01:59:13.170 --> 01:59:14.160
Some confidence, maybe.

1225
01:59:15.930 --> 01:59:16.680
Sharat Chandra: that's what i'm saying.

1226
01:59:18.570 --> 01:59:18.990
Rachana Kumbha: Okay.

1227
01:59:22.470 --> 01:59:33.030
Sharat Chandra: So when the actual result comes let's look at this so i'm basically saying 02 hundred 200 bucks you write the exam you get tourism you'll get some dessert.

1228
01:59:34.950 --> 01:59:35.280
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1229
01:59:36.540 --> 01:59:39.270
Sharat Chandra: That is what we were trying to predict in the initial case.

1230
01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:47.250
Sharat Chandra: Yes, now that result will be in this range on the right, yes, so that means whatever I predicted is correct.

1231
01:59:50.340 --> 01:59:51.540
Sharat Chandra: But if I see.

1232
01:59:53.010 --> 01:59:58.440
Sharat Chandra: let's say 50 marks to say 50 to 80 bucks.

1233
02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:02.370
Sharat Chandra: Okay, my range is now 50 to 80 bucks.

1234
02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:19.140
Sharat Chandra: If this is the case when you write the exam there is always a chance that you have got more marks, whatever it is, at point one, two or 85 or 90 whatever, but there is still a chance that you might score more marks.

1235
02:00:22.020 --> 02:00:25.350
Sharat Chandra: Right, are there is a chance that you might get less than 15 months.

1236
02:00:27.150 --> 02:00:31.740
Sharat Chandra: If you have scored a mark, which is like 85 is my prediction correct.

1237
02:00:34.140 --> 02:00:36.720
Rachana Kumbha: No definitely so.

1238
02:00:36.900 --> 02:00:41.370
Sharat Chandra: I will not have the same confidence, where I have at this stage.

1239
02:00:45.540 --> 02:00:50.400
Sharat Chandra: 02 hundred percent i'll have 100% confident hundred percent sure that the result is.

1240
02:00:51.570 --> 02:00:53.400
Sharat Chandra: going to fall industry, but here it is not.

1241
02:00:54.990 --> 02:01:08.370
Sharat Chandra: that's that's what you're trying to understand now just imagine whatever i'm talking about just imagine on a range like this, this is your continuous scale okay X axis i'm saying 02 hundred.

1242
02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:13.680
Sharat Chandra: That means you're all the values will fall here on.

1243
02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:15.360
Sharat Chandra: Correct.

1244
02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:20.250
Sharat Chandra: area under the curve is hundred percent one.

1245
02:01:22.020 --> 02:01:26.970
Sharat Chandra: So any result that you're calculating will be in this accepted region hundred percent region.

1246
02:01:28.140 --> 02:01:29.310
Sharat Chandra: But if I see.

1247
02:01:30.750 --> 02:01:31.920
Sharat Chandra: 50 to 80.

1248
02:01:33.030 --> 02:01:35.130
Sharat Chandra: So 52 let's say at.

1249
02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:39.870
Sharat Chandra: This blue lines would be my range.

1250
02:01:43.350 --> 02:01:52.260
Sharat Chandra: And if the actual value falls within this range, only then i'm correct my prediction is that the left side and writes it portion.

1251
02:01:53.310 --> 02:01:53.670
Sharat Chandra: Is.

1252
02:01:55.170 --> 02:02:03.810
Sharat Chandra: The chance, where you're going wrong, these are if these values are falling on your mark is falling, with this then your prediction is wrong.

1253
02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:05.670
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1254
02:02:06.750 --> 02:02:18.240
Sharat Chandra: This so the chance, you have the confidence you have we diminish that chance or confidence is measured using this area.

1255
02:02:23.070 --> 02:02:29.970
Sharat Chandra: i'm just trying to bring up the same point again and again and again and again, because you need to understand the concept here.

1256
02:02:31.380 --> 02:02:40.020
Sharat Chandra: Now now now the coming back to this scenario credit cards in there you'll see the visualization also if you see this scenario.

1257
02:02:41.460 --> 02:02:45.120
Sharat Chandra: Can I see based on my sample.

1258
02:02:47.250 --> 02:02:49.110
Sharat Chandra: A single sample that we have taken.

1259
02:02:50.460 --> 02:02:51.990
Sharat Chandra: which takes 1990.

1260
02:02:53.220 --> 02:02:53.520
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1261
02:02:54.780 --> 02:02:57.180
Sharat Chandra: If we consider this as the result.

1262
02:02:59.460 --> 02:02:59.880
Sharat Chandra: Then.

1263
02:03:01.290 --> 02:03:03.990
Sharat Chandra: This may be not hundred percent correct.

1264
02:03:05.250 --> 02:03:06.150
Sharat Chandra: Why because.

1265
02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:10.470
Sharat Chandra: If my underlying sample very let's say.

1266
02:03:11.970 --> 02:03:15.300
Sharat Chandra: assume you're not doing this, but assume if you have that.

1267
02:03:17.220 --> 02:03:22.740
Sharat Chandra: Under samples in a different location, then your data would have been changed.

1268
02:03:24.330 --> 02:03:28.860
Sharat Chandra: Based on the locality, you might have a different set of customers.

1269
02:03:30.030 --> 02:03:35.760
Sharat Chandra: Right coming into the marketing campaign and different set of 140 people might come into picture right.

1270
02:03:37.140 --> 02:03:41.130
Sharat Chandra: In those different people are coming, then their bank balances will be different.

1271
02:03:42.690 --> 02:03:46.260
Sharat Chandra: And their usage will be different, so do you not get the same number isn't it.

1272
02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:54.210
Sharat Chandra: So there is a lot of uncertainty, because your samples can be.

1273
02:03:55.800 --> 02:04:05.220
Sharat Chandra: Right, so we don't consider or we don't trust, a single calculation also single point if I do the calculation does.

1274
02:04:06.450 --> 02:04:12.810
Sharat Chandra: Property Z so considering both these concepts, we are coming up with a range.

1275
02:04:14.010 --> 02:04:17.280
Sharat Chandra: As an answer that range is called us confidence interval.

1276
02:04:19.590 --> 02:04:26.010
Sharat Chandra: That confidence interval basically is calculated us point estimate plus or minus margin margin of error.

1277
02:04:31.170 --> 02:04:32.370
Sharat Chandra: Point estimate.

1278
02:04:33.570 --> 02:04:36.060
Sharat Chandra: Is your sample statistic.

1279
02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:46.380
Sharat Chandra: sample statistic margin of error is the variation that we have within that.

1280
02:04:48.780 --> 02:04:54.120
Sharat Chandra: sounds I mean if I have in the central limit theorem we discussed all this right.

1281
02:04:56.730 --> 02:04:59.580
Sharat Chandra: If I have multiple sample statistic sample means.

1282
02:05:01.050 --> 02:05:04.650
Sharat Chandra: Then first movement of this random variable.

1283
02:05:06.090 --> 02:05:11.190
Sharat Chandra: will be population parameter, but if I look into the second moment.

1284
02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:19.230
Sharat Chandra: Second moment is the variation in this data with respect to him is calculated Sigma squared off.

1285
02:05:23.250 --> 02:05:25.380
Sharat Chandra: Okay scary Sigma pi squared.

1286
02:05:31.710 --> 02:05:36.180
Sharat Chandra: Right, but again, if I further expand this.

1287
02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:51.720
Sharat Chandra: The variations can basically influence the confidence Okay, so the margin of error that we are talking about is associated with the confidence level.

1288
02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:55.830
Sharat Chandra: Get the score less confidence level.

1289
02:05:57.510 --> 02:05:58.560
Sharat Chandra: Confidence values.

1290
02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:03.720
Sharat Chandra: So X bar is your point estimate.

1291
02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.310
Sharat Chandra: Right and that X bar.

1292
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:13.230
Sharat Chandra: is also getting married by so much.

1293
02:06:17.250 --> 02:06:25.980
Sharat Chandra: The zoom we are taking Z because we are talking about statistic being right normally distributed so we're comparing it with the values are.

1294
02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:29.550
Sharat Chandra: So, to get the range we're looking at zebra.

1295
02:06:31.500 --> 02:06:35.850
Sharat Chandra: Now, this one minus alpha that you're seeing is called us confidence level.

1296
02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:40.830
Sharat Chandra: Right and alpha is called us significance live.

1297
02:06:45.780 --> 02:06:50.700
Sharat Chandra: i'm going various you know i'm trying to bring out all those right aspects that you that are mandatory for us.

1298
02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:54.060
Sharat Chandra: To understand any questions, please ask me.

1299
02:06:55.470 --> 02:06:56.160
Sharat Chandra: Do not hesitate minority.

1300
02:07:00.060 --> 02:07:05.490
Sharat Chandra: So alpha is representing significance level, this is nothing by.

1301
02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:07.860
Sharat Chandra: The error push.

1302
02:07:10.950 --> 02:07:12.060
Sharat Chandra: chance off.

1303
02:07:13.260 --> 02:07:13.710
Sharat Chandra: era.

1304
02:07:16.770 --> 02:07:21.630
Sharat Chandra: The industry right in athletics stream or in business scenarios.

1305
02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:26.100
Sharat Chandra: Whenever we want to try to do the predictions.

1306
02:07:27.630 --> 02:07:34.830
Sharat Chandra: Right, the predictions are, by default, always our band, assuming that we are 95% correct.

1307
02:07:38.280 --> 02:07:38.640
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

1308
02:07:43.380 --> 02:07:52.620
Sharat Chandra: So this is called as 95% confidence level if I use that 95% confidence level, I will get confidence interval.

1309
02:07:55.260 --> 02:07:56.970
Sharat Chandra: That means, if this is my.

1310
02:07:58.440 --> 02:08:03.660
Sharat Chandra: Go bunker i'm saying that i'm 95% correct.

1311
02:08:05.640 --> 02:08:08.190
Sharat Chandra: me this is the portion where your data force.

1312
02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:13.080
Sharat Chandra: You still have chance of going wrong, but that is very little.

1313
02:08:14.700 --> 02:08:22.110
Sharat Chandra: Right, so now, what is this value if I know that on Z, then the calibration can that.

1314
02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:25.350
Sharat Chandra: So how do we get this value.

1315
02:08:26.550 --> 02:08:40.560
Sharat Chandra: To look at this I have X bar 19 $90 I have Sigma 2833 This is one for T squared off and small sample sample sizes 140.

1316
02:08:41.790 --> 02:08:42.120
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1317
02:08:43.980 --> 02:08:52.170
Sharat Chandra: This is the portion where I need to do the math now and to get to as well, if I can get that, then I can calculate the confidence.

1318
02:08:54.780 --> 02:08:56.250
Sharat Chandra: So industrial standard is.

1319
02:08:56.250 --> 02:08:59.340
Sharat Chandra: 95%, so we will assume that apartment is our first.

1320
02:08:59.490 --> 02:09:00.030
95.

1321
02:09:01.980 --> 02:09:07.020
Sharat Chandra: So that means I know the area under the curve.

1322
02:09:08.460 --> 02:09:13.380
Sharat Chandra: But what are these values which gives us that area is something that we have to find out.

1323
02:09:15.090 --> 02:09:16.830
Paramesh Putha: about the rain would be very wide.

1324
02:09:18.990 --> 02:09:19.320
Sharat Chandra: By.

1325
02:09:20.700 --> 02:09:27.300
Paramesh Putha: Like if we take 95% like it's like predicting the mass will be between 20 and 99.

1326
02:09:29.910 --> 02:09:33.480
Sharat Chandra: Because you're talking about distribution of the data we don't know what our values are you fall.

1327
02:09:35.610 --> 02:09:51.120
Sharat Chandra: Yes, right so range may or may not be that big we don't know, and it was the shape of the car remember the normal distribution shape of the car is influencing all these things, what if your shape is like this.

1328
02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:56.880
Sharat Chandra: yeah this is Max assume this is your marks.

1329
02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:07.170
Sharat Chandra: yeah yes, so in that case only limited little portion of data is going to fall in the stadium majority is going to fall here.

1330
02:10:08.310 --> 02:10:09.360
Sharat Chandra: But what if I have.

1331
02:10:10.920 --> 02:10:11.580
Sharat Chandra: This case.

1332
02:10:14.100 --> 02:10:16.710
Sharat Chandra: Then yeah you can see that right.

1333
02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:21.180
Sharat Chandra: Good amount of data falling in this significance region as well.

1334
02:10:22.260 --> 02:10:24.180
Sharat Chandra: So it's all about the distribution of the data.

1335
02:10:25.500 --> 02:10:25.860
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

1336
02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:28.650
Sharat Chandra: So.

1337
02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:30.180
Coming back to this discussion.

1338
02:10:31.530 --> 02:10:34.050
Sharat Chandra: Reno know area under the curve.

1339
02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:38.700
Sharat Chandra: Okay, we know the area under the curve.

1340
02:10:40.290 --> 02:10:48.060
Sharat Chandra: But what we want, we want this values right if it is Z then i'll put Z here.

1341
02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:50.670
Sharat Chandra: have to be with us to be.

1342
02:10:52.230 --> 02:11:11.910
Sharat Chandra: Z the Center will always be zero so this becomes minus Z because Z is standard normal distribution, which is perfectly symmetric and if this is zero this is he then this minus this will be minus end it is symmetric shape right, so it has to be minus.

1343
02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:16.110
Sharat Chandra: So that's about your.

1344
02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:24.690
Sharat Chandra: confidence, but if I consider this this shaded portion is 95%.

1345
02:11:26.130 --> 02:11:31.140
Sharat Chandra: That means 0.9%.

1346
02:11:37.980 --> 02:11:38.280
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1347
02:11:40.140 --> 02:11:49.170
Sharat Chandra: Now I want to identify what is this the values, using the tables, because in the table, we have the calculations already ready.

1348
02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:53.280
Sharat Chandra: In the previous example on the gmat scores.

1349
02:11:55.710 --> 02:12:03.390
Sharat Chandra: We knew X and from that we calculated Z then we refer to the table to get the probability or area.

1350
02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:08.760
Sharat Chandra: But now I have this area or probability.

1351
02:12:10.410 --> 02:12:16.200
Sharat Chandra: And I have to move backwards, so I will get Z using the table.

1352
02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:27.360
Sharat Chandra: hey, but if you talk about the table the table will contain all the values from minimum to that particular batch.

1353
02:12:28.500 --> 02:12:34.320
Sharat Chandra: Right so here in order to identify this number, we will take the left side.

1354
02:12:36.270 --> 02:12:36.960
Sharat Chandra: Blue shutters.

1355
02:12:38.850 --> 02:12:40.410
Sharat Chandra: So this is what we are going to take.

1356
02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:45.870
Sharat Chandra: The blue shaded portion.

1357
02:12:53.850 --> 02:13:01.650
Sharat Chandra: What will be that shaded portion crusaded portion if I have to try it and more a good image, this is the image when she image.

1358
02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:07.560
Sharat Chandra: were saying that 95% confidence right so let's say this is.

1359
02:13:09.660 --> 02:13:10.830
Sharat Chandra: This is 90% okay.

1360
02:13:12.090 --> 02:13:15.510
Sharat Chandra: So that means from here to here it is 95.

1361
02:13:19.710 --> 02:13:20.010
yeah.

1362
02:13:26.580 --> 02:13:34.050
Sharat Chandra: I need to know what will be this see this will be minus eight, this is, you know if I know this, I will be able to also know this because it is classy.

1363
02:13:37.620 --> 02:13:41.610
Sharat Chandra: yeah so Z table will always capture.

1364
02:13:42.660 --> 02:13:44.040
Sharat Chandra: The values which are from.

1365
02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:54.090
Sharat Chandra: left side value right it's always calculating the portion from lower minimum to that particular well.

1366
02:13:56.370 --> 02:13:56.790
Sharat Chandra: isn't it.

1367
02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:03.360
Sharat Chandra: So what is this portion.

1368
02:14:06.300 --> 02:14:08.970
Sharat Chandra: This is 95% So what will be this portion rates.

1369
02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:14.040
Paramesh Putha: mean minus four minus at my age standard deviation.

1370
02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:18.390
Sharat Chandra: whoa whoa whoa whoa no i'm talking about area under the curve shader ocean.

1371
02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:21.330
Sharat Chandra: Exactly.

1372
02:14:23.580 --> 02:14:24.090
that's good.

1373
02:14:25.980 --> 02:14:40.290
Sharat Chandra: 2.5% why because they yeah and that discovers 95 that means total will be remaining 5% but Z symmetric so that 5% is getting further divided this is.

1374
02:14:41.580 --> 02:14:42.150
Sharat Chandra: To banter.

1375
02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:46.740
Sharat Chandra: This is corners alpha by two alpha by two.

1376
02:14:47.790 --> 02:14:50.940
Sharat Chandra: Okay, and this portion is called as one minus and.

1377
02:14:54.300 --> 02:14:55.320
Sharat Chandra: This is one man is that.

1378
02:14:59.910 --> 02:15:09.450
Sharat Chandra: If this is 2.5 percentage if I convert this into decimals what will be the result 0.0 to five right for.

1379
02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:12.930
Sharat Chandra: developer hundred I get 0.0.

1380
02:15:14.970 --> 02:15:15.330
Sharat Chandra: Correct.

1381
02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:18.150
Sharat Chandra: So we will go to.

1382
02:15:19.170 --> 02:15:20.010
Sharat Chandra: The table.

1383
02:15:26.010 --> 02:15:28.230
Sharat Chandra: I will search for the value, which is.

1384
02:15:29.490 --> 02:15:34.590
Sharat Chandra: This shaded portion which is 0.025 that gives me dizzy by.

1385
02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:41.250
Sharat Chandra: So if I look around the this table where will I have 0.025.

1386
02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:55.980
Sharat Chandra: I see some number, but this is 0.00 to five, that is not the value that we want, we want 0.025.

1387
02:15:59.850 --> 02:16:13.980
Sharat Chandra: This is occurring when my value is minus 1.96.

1388
02:16:17.850 --> 02:16:18.660
Sharat Chandra: yeah that means.

1389
02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:23.850
Sharat Chandra: This portion that we're talking about is.

1390
02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:34.920
Sharat Chandra: minus 1.968 if I remove this this becomes plus 1.96 and this becomes minus 1.6.

1391
02:16:39.330 --> 02:16:39.660
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1392
02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:43.200
This is minus 1.96.

1393
02:16:45.270 --> 02:16:51.690
Sharat Chandra: This is plus 1.6 is this clear to everyone.

1394
02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:00.600
Paramesh Putha: Not.

1395
02:17:00.630 --> 02:17:02.280
Sharat Chandra: Everyone is done from is this clear.

1396
02:17:02.310 --> 02:17:02.880
TV.

1397
02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:11.340
Sharat Chandra: Okay, I want you people to now.

1398
02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:14.250
Sharat Chandra: Do the calculation for.

1399
02:17:15.990 --> 02:17:20.610
Sharat Chandra: 90% and 99% also.

1400
02:17:34.230 --> 02:17:37.470
Sharat Chandra: Do the calibration ways for 90% first.

1401
02:18:07.860 --> 02:18:08.340
Sharat Chandra: done.

1402
02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:48.480
Sharat Chandra: what's up guys.

1403
02:19:14.100 --> 02:19:16.200
Sharat Chandra: That means it's not clear for you people still.

1404
02:19:16.980 --> 02:19:23.550
1.644 90% 31.6 190.

1405
02:19:25.110 --> 02:19:25.950
Sharat Chandra: Okay, very good.

1406
02:19:56.760 --> 02:20:07.980
Paramesh Putha: Point 074 9931 07.

1407
02:20:14.310 --> 02:20:20.280
Rachana Kumbha: So, can you please like once again explain, for 95% i'm just trying to figure out for 95.

1408
02:20:21.810 --> 02:20:26.790
Sharat Chandra: see whether it is 90% 95% or 99% we have.

1409
02:20:26.910 --> 02:20:27.810
Sharat Chandra: The area.

1410
02:20:29.430 --> 02:20:41.070
Sharat Chandra: Okay, under the bell curve ignore the area 90% in this example, it is 90% okay now I need to know what what Z values.

1411
02:20:42.780 --> 02:20:45.030
Sharat Chandra: We are getting this portion as 90%.

1412
02:20:46.470 --> 02:20:51.090
Sharat Chandra: Okay, where this is symmetrical curve, so it will be plus or minus Z.

1413
02:20:52.800 --> 02:20:55.890
Sharat Chandra: We are trying to figure out what is that plus or minus diva you.

1414
02:20:57.360 --> 02:20:57.810
Rachana Kumbha: Okay.

1415
02:20:58.680 --> 02:21:08.400
Sharat Chandra: So for that, if I have to refer to the table the table always calculates only the left side portion of your bell shaped curve.

1416
02:21:10.050 --> 02:21:11.640
Sharat Chandra: Facility for calculations.

1417
02:21:12.840 --> 02:21:17.160
Sharat Chandra: Okay, so that means if I need to know what is this minus Z.

1418
02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:22.050
Sharat Chandra: Then I need to know what does this say that portion in the first.

1419
02:21:24.960 --> 02:21:27.090
Sharat Chandra: Okay, if this is 90%.

1420
02:21:27.600 --> 02:21:28.110
Rachana Kumbha: Okay, this will be.

1421
02:21:28.740 --> 02:21:30.390
Sharat Chandra: The outside is 10%.

1422
02:21:32.970 --> 02:21:33.180
Rachana Kumbha: yeah.

1423
02:21:33.210 --> 02:21:34.440
Sharat Chandra: This is your alpha.

1424
02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:40.800
Sharat Chandra: 90% is one minus alpha so alpha is 910 percent.

1425
02:21:41.910 --> 02:21:46.350
Sharat Chandra: Right, but this is only alpha by two this is alpha right.

1426
02:21:48.900 --> 02:21:50.310
Sharat Chandra: Right yes.

1427
02:21:51.810 --> 02:22:03.030
Sharat Chandra: This is alpha by two that means it's 5% 5% means in decimals what is the value 0.0505.

1428
02:22:04.230 --> 02:22:08.940
Sharat Chandra: So i'm going to refer to the 0.05 in the Z table.

1429
02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:22.350
Sharat Chandra: Where is my 0.0 0.05 0.05.

1430
02:22:24.270 --> 02:22:33.510
Sharat Chandra: Sorry, I do not have exactly 0.05, but I see that there is five units additional five units less.

1431
02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:41.790
Sharat Chandra: And that value is occurring at 1.64 at this Center averages average of these two.

1432
02:22:43.080 --> 02:22:46.920
Sharat Chandra: So this is going to give us plus or minus 1.64.

1433
02:22:48.540 --> 02:22:48.990
Okay.

1434
02:22:50.400 --> 02:22:50.880
OK so.

1435
02:22:53.730 --> 02:22:59.490
Sharat Chandra: now use the same logic try to do it for 99%.

1436
02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:02.310
Paramesh Putha: i'm getting my supervisor so.

1437
02:23:04.140 --> 02:23:04.740
Could we.

1438
02:23:08.460 --> 02:23:14.010
Sharat Chandra: It is 99% 99.

1439
02:23:15.240 --> 02:23:21.210
Sharat Chandra: This becomes 1% that means this because point 5% That means there is another zero here.

1440
02:23:24.120 --> 02:23:27.450
Sharat Chandra: Are you looking at values with 0.005.

1441
02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:36.270
Sharat Chandra: Okay, so what is the value that you're getting 2.57 2.507.

1442
02:23:37.350 --> 02:23:39.090
How sweet.

1443
02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:43.170
Sharat Chandra: 2.5.

1444
02:23:47.100 --> 02:23:47.580
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

1445
02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:51.960
Sharat Chandra: But it's not 0.005 right exactly.

1446
02:23:52.650 --> 02:23:53.070
yeah.

1447
02:23:59.700 --> 02:24:04.710
Sharat Chandra: So this episode minus 2.575.

1448
02:24:06.840 --> 02:24:08.190
Sharat Chandra: Average of 70 and.

1449
02:24:08.190 --> 02:24:12.000
82.757.

1450
02:24:13.650 --> 02:24:23.250
Sharat Chandra: Now this is plus or minus not just my best, because you might also want to see that right side, so does exactly cemetery so this busyness.

1451
02:24:25.290 --> 02:24:28.020
Sharat Chandra: That so we see the.

1452
02:24:29.880 --> 02:24:30.300
data.

1453
02:24:35.370 --> 02:24:42.420
Rachana Kumbha: yeah if you want to consider to the left side, we have to consider it as minus and to the right side, we have to consider it as plus yes.

1454
02:24:43.170 --> 02:24:43.590
Yes.

1455
02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.310
Sharat Chandra: So this on to this 2157.

1456
02:24:59.790 --> 02:25:05.670
Sharat Chandra: This value is something that you have to buy heart plus or minus 1.96.

1457
02:25:08.640 --> 02:25:09.000
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

1458
02:25:13.530 --> 02:25:15.570
Sharat Chandra: Now let us go to the calculation.

1459
02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:21.450
Sharat Chandra: Calculations don't mind just a very simple calculation all these values are given.

1460
02:25:25.920 --> 02:25:26.220
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1461
02:25:27.330 --> 02:25:39.090
Sharat Chandra: So if I do Sigma squared, and this is that is that accurate in average is this the confidence interval or you can also call it as interval estimate is equal to.

1462
02:25:40.380 --> 02:25:44.100
Sharat Chandra: Point estimate plus or minus margin of error.

1463
02:25:46.080 --> 02:26:00.360
Sharat Chandra: Point estimate is the statistic that you have categorical in our case, it is expert plus or minus margin of error margin of error is basically taken a Z it's one minus alpha into Sigma squared off in.

1464
02:26:04.110 --> 02:26:09.450
Sharat Chandra: Red one minus alpha is called as confidence level, this is.

1465
02:26:10.740 --> 02:26:13.680
Sharat Chandra: main different presented this to to have to do that.

1466
02:26:15.210 --> 02:26:20.790
Sharat Chandra: The Z value is plus or minus 1.96 here we are saying.

1467
02:26:25.980 --> 02:26:28.980
Sharat Chandra: 1990 X bar.

1468
02:26:30.510 --> 02:26:34.980
Sharat Chandra: plus or minus Z has one minus alpha.

1469
02:26:37.770 --> 02:26:39.090
Sharat Chandra: To summarize what six.

1470
02:26:40.710 --> 02:26:45.600
Sharat Chandra: Sigma by Square and to 11.2 main.

1471
02:26:48.150 --> 02:26:53.220
Sharat Chandra: comma plus 1.96 into cooler and cooler.

1472
02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:55.200
Sharat Chandra: This is the range.

1473
02:26:57.060 --> 02:27:02.760
Sharat Chandra: If it has to be 90% confidence, confidence is decreasing right so.

1474
02:27:03.810 --> 02:27:08.820
Sharat Chandra: Your range will also decrease 1990 plus plus or minus my by.

1475
02:27:15.750 --> 02:27:16.890
Sharat Chandra: This is minus.

1476
02:27:18.180 --> 02:27:30.390
Sharat Chandra: 1.645 into to 11.29 comma 1990 plus 1.645 into to learn.

1477
02:27:32.940 --> 02:27:42.810
Sharat Chandra: This 6.1 foreign minus plus or minus 1.96 that we see that is the only value, which is changing in both these things and based on that change the range of luxury to.

1478
02:27:45.870 --> 02:27:46.230
Sharat Chandra: Get.

1479
02:27:54.840 --> 02:27:55.920
Sharat Chandra: your questions.

1480
02:28:06.450 --> 02:28:07.920
Sharat Chandra: Okay i'm assuming no questions.

1481
02:28:08.340 --> 02:28:12.360
Paramesh Putha: Like, we have to do this only after making the data into normal later.

1482
02:28:14.550 --> 02:28:15.450
Sharat Chandra: Absolutely.

1483
02:28:17.460 --> 02:28:18.840
Sharat Chandra: Data has to be normal.

1484
02:28:22.980 --> 02:28:29.250
Rachana Kumbha: So we have to use the appropriate transformation technique and then make it normal and then apply this.

1485
02:28:30.570 --> 02:28:31.200
Rachana Kumbha: In Python.

1486
02:28:31.650 --> 02:28:32.790
Sharat Chandra: Okay, yes, yes, yes.

1487
02:28:35.520 --> 02:28:48.960
Sharat Chandra: Now, whatever the languages that are a SAS based tool, whether it is our whether it's by them or any other tool that we, we probably might want to use this is the logic that you have to data has to be normal in order to interpret all this.

1488
02:28:49.860 --> 02:28:55.800
Sharat Chandra: location right, yes, so we will take a small break now.

1489
02:28:57.060 --> 02:28:58.380
Sharat Chandra: it's a 440.

1490
02:29:02.070 --> 02:29:05.070
Sharat Chandra: will connect at 448 eight minutes.

1491
02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:12.570
Sharat Chandra: not going under the break to another so yeah eight minutes just just come back in eight minutes guys.

1492
02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:34.110
Sharat Chandra: So there does seem to see.

1493
02:29:34.770 --> 02:29:35.250
Paramesh Putha: Someone oh.

1494
02:29:36.240 --> 02:29:36.870
Sharat Chandra: yeah good good.

1495
02:29:37.560 --> 02:29:54.270
Paramesh Putha: So in this case, actually, we want the population standard deviation but impractical impractical as like after getting like we after doing some one for the customer, so we can get a standard standard deviation for one last question oh so.

1496
02:29:55.260 --> 02:30:00.090
Sharat Chandra: yeah that that's the next concept punish will discuss that with me.

1497
02:30:02.100 --> 02:30:02.820
Sharat Chandra: Good good.

1498
02:30:03.540 --> 02:30:04.620
Sharat Chandra: Right analysis.

1499
02:30:05.760 --> 02:30:09.030
Sharat Chandra: that's one of the important point that we have to discuss.

1500
02:30:11.550 --> 02:30:16.500
Sharat Chandra: Okay, so before we go to that let's talk about the things that we discuss now.

1501
02:30:17.760 --> 02:30:25.920
Sharat Chandra: So confidence interval is basically nothing but that interval that we have to come up with for predictions.

1502
02:30:27.840 --> 02:30:36.210
Sharat Chandra: And this is basically done on let's say point estimate plus or minus the error that that we have because of the sampling variation.

1503
02:30:37.770 --> 02:30:39.270
Sharat Chandra: We call it a margin of it.

1504
02:30:40.440 --> 02:30:49.560
Sharat Chandra: So point estimate is nothing but the calculation that will be doing, because we will always work with a single sample on will not work with multiple templates or a single jump.

1505
02:30:50.670 --> 02:30:58.770
Sharat Chandra: So point estimate plus or minus margin of error will vary, based on the confidence that we are trying to print.

1506
02:31:00.390 --> 02:31:02.760
Sharat Chandra: Because of Z at one minus alpha.

1507
02:31:05.040 --> 02:31:10.890
Sharat Chandra: into the variation with among the multiple samples that might have.

1508
02:31:12.660 --> 02:31:17.850
Sharat Chandra: So that variation is called as a standard error, this is called a standard error.

1509
02:31:20.700 --> 02:31:24.420
Sharat Chandra: Is not standard deviation standard deviation speaks about.

1510
02:31:25.890 --> 02:31:27.660
Sharat Chandra: The variation in one sample.

1511
02:31:29.490 --> 02:31:42.450
Sharat Chandra: That variation of the individual records, with respect to the mean, but here standard error, we are trying to interpret the variation among the surface multiple sound.

1512
02:31:44.160 --> 02:31:45.600
Sharat Chandra: Good, this is the formula.

1513
02:31:48.060 --> 02:32:01.170
Sharat Chandra: Now, when we do the calculations, the confidence level is something that we have to measure it has nothing but the points on the Z axis, which give us the area under the curve.

1514
02:32:02.670 --> 02:32:06.540
Sharat Chandra: So if I know that area under the curve being 95%.

1515
02:32:07.830 --> 02:32:12.900
Sharat Chandra: Then, what is this Z that's what we're trying to identify minus n plus.

1516
02:32:18.390 --> 02:32:36.330
Sharat Chandra: So when we do the calculation before that, let me record this Z value at 95% is plus or minus 1.960 90% is plus or minus 1.645.

1517
02:32:37.470 --> 02:32:43.170
Sharat Chandra: And zero 99% is plus or minus 2.575.

1518
02:32:44.280 --> 02:32:49.140
Sharat Chandra: Now these three standard values or something that you might want to remember.

1519
02:32:50.400 --> 02:32:52.230
Sharat Chandra: Okay, especially this.

1520
02:32:54.600 --> 02:33:03.390
Sharat Chandra: That the default 190 5% confidence is the default confidence level that we need to measure that predictions.

1521
02:33:05.490 --> 02:33:05.790
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1522
02:33:10.050 --> 02:33:10.320
Sharat Chandra: Now.

1523
02:33:13.710 --> 02:33:22.710
Sharat Chandra: Then we do the calculation at 95% confidence right, this is the results that the calibration expert assignments, we get this.

1524
02:33:25.860 --> 02:33:31.680
Sharat Chandra: night, but if you look at those results, the statements that we pass it.

1525
02:33:33.030 --> 02:33:38.010
Sharat Chandra: Those statements should include all the references that we are basically using.

1526
02:33:40.230 --> 02:33:42.930
Sharat Chandra: The mean violence of the population nice industry.

1527
02:33:45.480 --> 02:33:54.420
Sharat Chandra: mean balance right off the population license the strange very good, so we are talking about meal lying in this range, but what confidence.

1528
02:33:57.180 --> 02:33:58.830
Sharat Chandra: Is it 90% 95%.

1529
02:34:00.240 --> 02:34:07.230
Sharat Chandra: That is not explained by so confidence level is not given here, so this cannot be here right state.

1530
02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:15.420
Sharat Chandra: mean balance is in this range 95% of the time, so this is given.

1531
02:34:16.980 --> 02:34:20.340
Sharat Chandra: But mean balance is it new or is it X bar.

1532
02:34:21.360 --> 02:34:23.940
Sharat Chandra: That is not mentioned, so this is also not.

1533
02:34:26.310 --> 02:34:40.890
Sharat Chandra: We have to refer to the sample also and we are making the statement because using that sample only we are getting this stuff, and this is completely wrong because you cannot use only 95% of the customers, you have to use 100% of the data.

1534
02:34:43.650 --> 02:34:46.290
Sharat Chandra: So the only to corrupt interpretations, at least.

1535
02:34:49.320 --> 02:34:51.150
Sharat Chandra: and basically we are saying.

1536
02:34:52.980 --> 02:35:03.750
Sharat Chandra: mean of the population has 95% chance of being in this range for a random sample That means, if you take any random sample.

1537
02:35:04.800 --> 02:35:13.140
Sharat Chandra: And do the calculations, the mean of the population has 95% chance of being in this range.

1538
02:35:16.830 --> 02:35:17.130
Sharat Chandra: Right I.

1539
02:35:19.680 --> 02:35:24.810
Sharat Chandra: mean of the population will be in this day and mean of the population will be in this range.

1540
02:35:27.180 --> 02:35:32.190
Sharat Chandra: right for 95% of the run up so that means if I take hundred samples.

1541
02:35:33.540 --> 02:35:38.850
Sharat Chandra: Then 95% of the samples X bar values will lie in this range God.

1542
02:35:40.860 --> 02:35:48.480
Sharat Chandra: And that's that's what the second statement So these are the only two statements which are correct, not these three.

1543
02:35:50.160 --> 02:36:00.120
Sharat Chandra: So, ultimately, we are saying that this is the population result parameter, but that is obtained using sample statistic and at certain confidentially.

1544
02:36:01.860 --> 02:36:05.280
Sharat Chandra: So if you use all these three, then these are corrupt interpretations.

1545
02:36:10.140 --> 02:36:14.190
Sharat Chandra: Now the actual question counts the formula.

1546
02:36:16.380 --> 02:36:26.490
Sharat Chandra: Confidence interval is X bar plus on my eyes, I mean margin of error rate, so it is a point estimate plus or minus margin of error.

1547
02:36:27.720 --> 02:36:29.670
Sharat Chandra: The margin of error is nothing but.

1548
02:36:31.590 --> 02:36:34.170
Sharat Chandra: see it when when is i'll find to standard error.

1549
02:36:35.700 --> 02:36:38.160
Sharat Chandra: standard is nothing but Sigma squared.

1550
02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:45.240
Sharat Chandra: Now this formula is used to calculate or estimate parameter.

1551
02:36:47.100 --> 02:36:50.970
Sharat Chandra: admins on population data, what will be the results.

1552
02:36:55.350 --> 02:37:00.360
Sharat Chandra: But this is done in the first place, because we only have sample data we don't have population.

1553
02:37:01.980 --> 02:37:05.370
Sharat Chandra: The population data is not available then how can I get this parent.

1554
02:37:08.130 --> 02:37:25.770
Sharat Chandra: it's rather a I cannot have a parameter used to calculate another parameter because, if I am able to get this parameter, then I should be able to be also get this parameter right I don't need to do all these big calculations not required.

1555
02:37:27.780 --> 02:37:28.080
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1556
02:37:30.450 --> 02:37:32.280
Sharat Chandra: So practically speaking.

1557
02:37:33.660 --> 02:37:36.060
Sharat Chandra: You will not have Sigma.

1558
02:37:37.890 --> 02:37:47.940
Sharat Chandra: theta if the bankers new one, hence the population standard deviation from the previous lunches is not reuse, that means I don't know what was the previous lunch average.

1559
02:37:49.110 --> 02:37:50.310
Sharat Chandra: There is seek my is not.

1560
02:37:53.310 --> 02:37:54.330
Sharat Chandra: What are we doing.

1561
02:37:55.410 --> 02:37:59.220
Sharat Chandra: We are calculating new using expert point St.

1562
02:38:01.050 --> 02:38:09.450
Sharat Chandra: hey if I don't know Sigma can I also not use sample standard deviation to estimate population standard deviation.

1563
02:38:11.340 --> 02:38:13.140
Sharat Chandra: that's what we are doing in the first place right.

1564
02:38:18.930 --> 02:38:22.260
Sharat Chandra: We are trying to take statistic to interpret for parameter.

1565
02:38:23.430 --> 02:38:28.680
Sharat Chandra: Correct, so we are trying to do that heroes, not just on the meal, but also send division.

1566
02:38:31.320 --> 02:38:35.520
Sharat Chandra: So the best the replacement for Sigma is its finest.

1567
02:38:37.110 --> 02:38:42.810
Sharat Chandra: But if I have to do the calculation, we are considering the variation aspect is what.

1568
02:38:46.110 --> 02:38:53.190
Sharat Chandra: I get our data to take X bar because it's but keeps changing isn't it, the reason why we have to see equation confidence interval equation.

1569
02:38:55.050 --> 02:38:59.940
Sharat Chandra: Then, how can I blindly estimate Sigma using yes here also there will be variation right.

1570
02:39:02.340 --> 02:39:04.290
Sharat Chandra: That variation also should be captured.

1571
02:39:05.850 --> 02:39:13.320
Sharat Chandra: If I have to use small, as in the equation, and a variation that comes with this Sigma is also something that we have to consider.

1572
02:39:16.800 --> 02:39:17.100
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1573
02:39:20.430 --> 02:39:22.590
Sharat Chandra: So to capture that variation.

1574
02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:29.820
Sharat Chandra: That is under distribution called T distribution, and this, the distribution is used.

1575
02:39:33.060 --> 02:39:34.800
Sharat Chandra: Okay, p distribution is just.

1576
02:39:36.450 --> 02:39:39.810
Sharat Chandra: A distribution is also known as student tea distribution.

1577
02:39:41.130 --> 02:39:47.850
Sharat Chandra: Which is also branch, you can say of normal distribution date same normal distribution concept.

1578
02:39:52.500 --> 02:40:02.010
Sharat Chandra: hey so rather than Z distribution now, we will have to use the distribution, which also accounts to be variation of the Sigma.

1579
02:40:03.870 --> 02:40:05.340
Sharat Chandra: variation calculating same.

1580
02:40:07.890 --> 02:40:08.820
Sharat Chandra: Right so that's.

1581
02:40:10.500 --> 02:40:12.480
Sharat Chandra: The key distribution usage.

1582
02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:18.060
Sharat Chandra: T distribution, as I mentioned, is just like a standard.

1583
02:40:19.770 --> 02:40:20.880
Sharat Chandra: has one property.

1584
02:40:22.410 --> 02:40:28.110
Sharat Chandra: It is very similar to see that one difference is basically the category property of your peers.

1585
02:40:29.580 --> 02:40:30.480
Sharat Chandra: And that is.

1586
02:40:31.830 --> 02:40:32.550
Sharat Chandra: This property.

1587
02:40:38.550 --> 02:40:45.900
Sharat Chandra: As then how the sample size increases that T distribution tends to become Z distribution.

1588
02:40:51.510 --> 02:40:58.980
Sharat Chandra: So D distribution will also get affected with the sample size, which is also expressed as degrees of freedom.

1589
02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:01.890
Sharat Chandra: And minus one.

1590
02:41:03.960 --> 02:41:06.960
Sharat Chandra: minus to read those degrees of freedom to be used.

1591
02:41:09.330 --> 02:41:14.250
Sharat Chandra: So, if your degrees of freedom is one that means your sample size is too.

1592
02:41:15.900 --> 02:41:16.470
Sharat Chandra: Then.

1593
02:41:17.730 --> 02:41:20.520
Sharat Chandra: This becomes your Z this becomes your.

1594
02:41:23.370 --> 02:41:24.270
Sharat Chandra: Right Z.

1595
02:41:26.220 --> 02:41:26.970
Sharat Chandra: You can see.

1596
02:41:28.590 --> 02:41:30.390
Sharat Chandra: That there's a clear case of difference.

1597
02:41:33.060 --> 02:41:33.420
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1598
02:41:34.470 --> 02:41:36.600
Sharat Chandra: Different clear differences.

1599
02:41:37.950 --> 02:41:41.070
Sharat Chandra: But as the sample size increases.

1600
02:41:43.620 --> 02:41:52.050
Sharat Chandra: As the sample size keep increasing that gap between these two is reduced, and at this stage it's almost equal.

1601
02:41:53.580 --> 02:41:55.740
Sharat Chandra: But they are not going to be exactly.

1602
02:41:57.750 --> 02:41:58.080
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1603
02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:03.060
Sharat Chandra: So this is.

1604
02:42:05.130 --> 02:42:10.620
Sharat Chandra: N minus 130 degrees and almost to touch that's your property.

1605
02:42:11.970 --> 02:42:15.510
Sharat Chandra: They will not be exactly the same, but there will be very, very close.

1606
02:42:18.870 --> 02:42:22.020
Sharat Chandra: If n is tending to become infinity.

1607
02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:30.090
Sharat Chandra: And is increasing sample sizes increasing that means if sample size increases the variation is that using zenda.

1608
02:42:32.130 --> 02:42:35.370
Sharat Chandra: So your tea distribution tends to become Z distribution.

1609
02:42:37.110 --> 02:42:44.220
Sharat Chandra: See very, very simple, if this is my population if I take a small sample then there could be a lot of variation between the sand.

1610
02:42:45.660 --> 02:42:47.490
Sharat Chandra: Right between the values that will not have a.

1611
02:42:48.600 --> 02:42:55.170
Sharat Chandra: But if my sample size increases, then that variation between the samples will be there.

1612
02:42:57.210 --> 02:42:57.510
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1613
02:42:59.340 --> 02:43:01.800
Sharat Chandra: And the distribution is all about capturing that way.

1614
02:43:03.060 --> 02:43:07.500
Sharat Chandra: So as Z as n tends to infinity T tends to becomes.

1615
02:43:13.050 --> 02:43:16.170
Sharat Chandra: And a formula is changing like this.

1616
02:43:18.660 --> 02:43:21.570
Sharat Chandra: In place of Sigma we are replacing.

1617
02:43:22.800 --> 02:43:23.550
Sharat Chandra: smallest.

1618
02:43:25.740 --> 02:43:26.040
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

1619
02:43:29.370 --> 02:43:35.700
Sharat Chandra: But as to counter this variations we bring in T distribution in place of CDs.

1620
02:43:38.940 --> 02:43:41.460
Sharat Chandra: Right, and here we have one minus alpha.

1621
02:43:42.480 --> 02:43:47.340
Sharat Chandra: And N minus one as well because T distribution is getting impacted by the sanford's.

1622
02:43:52.320 --> 02:43:52.620
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1623
02:43:54.510 --> 02:44:01.740
Sharat Chandra: Now I know what does expire, I know what is smallest, I know what is square root of n I don't know the tea distribution T values.

1624
02:44:02.940 --> 02:44:06.600
Sharat Chandra: So just like how we have the distribution.

1625
02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:13.320
Sharat Chandra: We also have P table just replace that Z with the that's a.

1626
02:44:16.500 --> 02:44:17.280
Sharat Chandra: that's your details.

1627
02:44:26.310 --> 02:44:27.990
Sharat Chandra: right hand this is your table.

1628
02:44:33.300 --> 02:44:36.030
Sharat Chandra: And yet this is the table.

1629
02:44:41.280 --> 02:44:45.390
Sharat Chandra: The table, you have to look at the first column.

1630
02:44:46.890 --> 02:44:48.480
Sharat Chandra: which has degrees of freedom.

1631
02:44:55.380 --> 02:45:03.630
Sharat Chandra: And at the bottom, you see the confidence level, Sir, I mean that's how we read it at the top, this is like one to two tails at all that you can ignore it.

1632
02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:11.040
Sharat Chandra: What it means we only look at left side who tells me boo the Bush okay.

1633
02:45:12.300 --> 02:45:13.680
Sharat Chandra: So that's basically your.

1634
02:45:15.150 --> 02:45:15.930
calculations.

1635
02:45:17.610 --> 02:45:20.310
Sharat Chandra: And the year we want.

1636
02:45:21.720 --> 02:45:22.620
Sharat Chandra: to capture.

1637
02:45:24.060 --> 02:45:27.930
Sharat Chandra: The P value for one minus Alpha and N minus one.

1638
02:45:30.390 --> 02:45:32.490
Sharat Chandra: One minus alpha is.

1639
02:45:33.810 --> 02:45:40.860
Sharat Chandra: 95% N minus one small island is 140 so this becomes 113.

1640
02:45:42.300 --> 02:45:44.040
Sharat Chandra: But if you look at the table here.

1641
02:45:45.330 --> 02:45:47.430
Sharat Chandra: We don't have one for.

1642
02:45:48.930 --> 02:45:51.270
Sharat Chandra: The next closest value is hundred.

1643
02:45:54.780 --> 02:45:58.920
Sharat Chandra: Okay, so we will take 95% at hand.

1644
02:46:01.290 --> 02:46:08.820
Sharat Chandra: And it's a physical page, so we cannot enjoy everything, but when we do the calculations you'll also get these exact values us.

1645
02:46:10.590 --> 02:46:13.980
Sharat Chandra: So 1.984.

1646
02:46:17.700 --> 02:46:23.010
Sharat Chandra: Alright, so that's your calculations, so we replace that P value with.

1647
02:46:24.480 --> 02:46:26.100
This calculation.

1648
02:46:28.650 --> 02:46:30.180
Sharat Chandra: And this is the numbers that you will see.

1649
02:46:33.300 --> 02:46:45.150
Sharat Chandra: So this is smallest 2833 right, and then you look at look at this and T value at 0.975 or 95%.

1650
02:46:46.380 --> 02:46:50.730
Sharat Chandra: is one that 1.988 degrees of freedom as 130.

1651
02:46:52.530 --> 02:46:56.070
Sharat Chandra: Okay don't get confused with 0.975.

1652
02:46:57.180 --> 02:46:58.470
Sharat Chandra: If this is your curve.

1653
02:47:00.210 --> 02:47:01.950
Sharat Chandra: If this is 95%.

1654
02:47:04.440 --> 02:47:15.750
Sharat Chandra: And then, this will be 2.5% So if I had both of them i'll get this he left said cumulative portion right for 97.5%.

1655
02:47:18.330 --> 02:47:19.440
Sharat Chandra: This is the Z value.

1656
02:47:20.820 --> 02:47:23.610
Sharat Chandra: Get 95.7 verse.

1657
02:47:25.350 --> 02:47:26.280
Sharat Chandra: hey, this is the.

1658
02:47:33.630 --> 02:47:41.160
Sharat Chandra: positive side, if you do have been this point, then you might want to write it as 0.025, and this will be one minus.

1659
02:47:44.190 --> 02:47:47.250
Sharat Chandra: minus 1.0 point nine.

1660
02:47:57.480 --> 02:47:58.890
Sharat Chandra: So when you do the calculation.

1661
02:48:02.910 --> 02:48:07.560
Sharat Chandra: very similar to the interpretation that we have done for the table same thing here on fertility.

1662
02:48:15.390 --> 02:48:15.690
Sharat Chandra: All right.

1663
02:48:22.740 --> 02:48:23.820
Sharat Chandra: Any questions.

1664
02:48:37.860 --> 02:48:39.120
Sharat Chandra: yeah guys any questions.

1665
02:48:45.390 --> 02:48:45.840
Sharat Chandra: nope so.

1666
02:48:49.500 --> 02:48:53.010
Sharat Chandra: Now these things that we have done manually right let's do that.

1667
02:48:54.090 --> 02:48:55.080
Sharat Chandra: In Python.

1668
02:48:58.020 --> 02:49:04.830
Sharat Chandra: So go on, let me down on the business basic Statistics Code that you have already have read and go all the way down.

1669
02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:16.950
Sharat Chandra: Standard edition normalization and after normal qq blood yeah this is busy distribution characteristics.

1670
02:49:19.890 --> 02:49:25.500
Sharat Chandra: Alright, so this is my data i'm importing side by dot stats.

1671
02:49:27.060 --> 02:49:41.130
Sharat Chandra: This is required because the Z distribution is calculated using this tax functionality so stats dot nom dot CDF CFS cumulative distribution function.

1672
02:49:43.110 --> 02:49:45.690
Sharat Chandra: It basically takes the X value.

1673
02:49:47.160 --> 02:49:48.210
Sharat Chandra: there's the syntax OK.

1674
02:49:49.350 --> 02:49:56.430
Sharat Chandra: Serious CDF X are your you can also call it a squad time comma new cameras.

1675
02:49:58.410 --> 02:50:07.980
Sharat Chandra: But this is the representation parameter representation, so we have six at mujer 711 segments 20.

1676
02:50:09.630 --> 02:50:11.490
Sharat Chandra: Right cumulative distribution function.

1677
02:50:13.170 --> 02:50:22.920
Sharat Chandra: If I execute this it will give me the area under the Left curve on the left side push that is your CD of cumulative.

1678
02:50:24.120 --> 02:50:25.260
Sharat Chandra: Distribution function.

1679
02:50:29.160 --> 02:50:31.260
Sharat Chandra: All you need to passes mean it standard.

1680
02:50:33.390 --> 02:50:36.210
Sharat Chandra: So this 14.25%, to be precise.

1681
02:50:38.520 --> 02:50:43.050
Sharat Chandra: Then we have point percent function or percentage point function.

1682
02:50:44.190 --> 02:50:45.780
Sharat Chandra: So I know the percentage.

1683
02:50:47.070 --> 02:50:50.280
Sharat Chandra: That I know the percentage.

1684
02:50:52.710 --> 02:50:56.850
Sharat Chandra: This is 0.025 I know this percentage.

1685
02:50:58.590 --> 02:51:01.170
Sharat Chandra: What is the point at which i'll get this person.

1686
02:51:03.570 --> 02:51:07.860
Sharat Chandra: and passing meal and Sigma for Z value status.

1687
02:51:08.940 --> 02:51:16.920
Sharat Chandra: Z has the standard right, even if we don't give by default you're assuming that the function as your status 01 Sigma.

1688
02:51:19.080 --> 02:51:21.660
Sharat Chandra: So we're talking about 0.0.

1689
02:51:25.110 --> 02:51:31.350
Sharat Chandra: So point 4% point function is giving us minus 1.96.

1690
02:51:36.570 --> 02:51:39.990
Sharat Chandra: Now this is what Z distribution normal distribution.

1691
02:51:41.220 --> 02:51:53.700
Sharat Chandra: same calculation, if I have to do the area under the curve, then I will be doing the distribution for CDF RT distribution for percent point function.

1692
02:51:55.650 --> 02:51:56.430
Sharat Chandra: Right So these are.

1693
02:51:58.620 --> 02:52:03.570
Sharat Chandra: The calculations stats dot T dot CDF but here i'm passing.

1694
02:52:05.370 --> 02:52:07.380
Sharat Chandra: The right value.

1695
02:52:08.550 --> 02:52:11.130
Sharat Chandra: The value with degrees of freedom.

1696
02:52:14.100 --> 02:52:15.630
Sharat Chandra: Alright So here we have to do.

1697
02:52:16.740 --> 02:52:21.870
Sharat Chandra: quantel value right so i'm passing that one time value, I am getting area under the.

1698
02:52:26.550 --> 02:52:26.880
Sharat Chandra: Great.

1699
02:52:31.320 --> 02:52:42.210
Sharat Chandra: same way if you see ppm I know this value what will be the I mean this is the area under the curve and what will be the exact P value at which we get.

1700
02:52:45.510 --> 02:52:49.650
Sharat Chandra: One minus 1.977 when very precise number calculations and.

1701
02:52:51.180 --> 02:52:52.380
Sharat Chandra: So this is the.

1702
02:52:54.780 --> 02:52:57.690
Sharat Chandra: Calculations that that basically are done.

1703
02:52:58.800 --> 02:53:01.620
Sharat Chandra: Yet all these way we're doing it in man.

1704
02:53:06.300 --> 02:53:08.280
Sharat Chandra: yeah so that's that's about your.

1705
02:53:11.640 --> 02:53:30.210
Sharat Chandra: theory of doing predictions on numeric data inferential statistics, so when you are doing inferential statistics, remember that the samples might vary, hence we have to consider that variation and then probability of single number is equal to zero hands, we have predicted in a REACH.

1706
02:53:31.410 --> 02:53:33.870
Sharat Chandra: And that's where confidence in the world coming to the picture.

1707
02:53:35.160 --> 02:53:44.970
Sharat Chandra: and confidence interval basically says point estimate plus or minus margin of error and the margin of error is associated with the confidence level.

1708
02:53:48.210 --> 02:54:02.340
Sharat Chandra: The range it which right the range, at which the results will fall under the bell curve, which is infinity skin we're trying to find out a range, in which the actual values might work for that becomes your competency.

1709
02:54:05.730 --> 02:54:15.030
Sharat Chandra: Okay, so that's your inferential statistics and using these inferential statistics we will basically take decisions.

1710
02:54:16.590 --> 02:54:18.120
Sharat Chandra: That informed decisions.

1711
02:54:19.980 --> 02:54:22.800
Sharat Chandra: For example, number in the credit card scenario.

1712
02:54:25.350 --> 02:54:25.650
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1713
02:54:28.560 --> 02:54:35.010
Sharat Chandra: Should I launched the credit card program or not to all my customers, something that you have to take a decision.

1714
02:54:36.390 --> 02:54:39.540
Sharat Chandra: So when you're looking at your investment and all that.

1715
02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:41.820
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1716
02:54:43.170 --> 02:54:49.020
Sharat Chandra: As from a business perspective okay from from a business perspective let's say you're you're looking at.

1717
02:54:57.810 --> 02:54:59.460
Sharat Chandra: Some let's see.

1718
02:55:03.600 --> 02:55:04.200
Sharat Chandra: let's see.

1719
02:55:05.730 --> 02:55:10.800
Sharat Chandra: yeah $2,000 is the calculation that you are getting for Roi.

1720
02:55:12.180 --> 02:55:14.790
Sharat Chandra: But whatever the investment that you, as you come in this video.

1721
02:55:17.970 --> 02:55:29.700
Sharat Chandra: If your balance is going to be 2000 or more for all the hundred thousand customers, this is your population right if this was the piece.

1722
02:55:32.700 --> 02:55:36.210
Sharat Chandra: hey, this is the estimation, so you are doing the calculations.

1723
02:55:37.800 --> 02:55:47.040
Sharat Chandra: So your business is very clear that you need to get $2,000 but unless until you do the business will not know whether you will get $2,000 or.

1724
02:55:48.690 --> 02:55:50.160
Sharat Chandra: Hence we do the.

1725
02:55:51.420 --> 02:55:55.560
Sharat Chandra: sample calculations that by legend.

1726
02:55:57.540 --> 02:56:08.340
Sharat Chandra: And within the pilot launch we get confidence interval we're trying to estimate the result so we'll get some range at 95% confidence if I have to take the default one.

1727
02:56:10.020 --> 02:56:16.110
Sharat Chandra: If my right reserved confidence interval that i'm getting is basically saying.

1728
02:56:18.180 --> 02:56:20.640
Sharat Chandra: 1800 to 1900.

1729
02:56:21.840 --> 02:56:23.250
Sharat Chandra: K let's say this is your range.

1730
02:56:25.740 --> 02:56:26.730
Sharat Chandra: If you are in since.

1731
02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:33.000
Sharat Chandra: As part of the calculations right pilot lunch.

1732
02:56:37.320 --> 02:56:40.710
Sharat Chandra: yeah if i'm getting this should I continue with the business.

1733
02:56:49.080 --> 02:56:50.490
Sharat Chandra: Should we continue with the business case.

1734
02:57:07.080 --> 02:57:08.730
Paramesh Putha: depends on the credit card limit.

1735
02:57:10.380 --> 02:57:16.080
Sharat Chandra: already mentioned be made of it then on investment is calculated as.

1736
02:57:16.770 --> 02:57:30.990
Sharat Chandra: $2,000 which basically means that the minimum balance that all these hundred thousand customers should maintain 2000, this is the guideline the businesses deciding based on all the calculations on the investment that they have made, and all that.

1737
02:57:32.280 --> 02:57:38.730
Sharat Chandra: From a business perspective management is clear, they need to get $2,000 to make business profitable.

1738
02:57:41.190 --> 02:57:41.610
Paramesh Putha: than.

1739
02:57:42.420 --> 02:57:46.470
Sharat Chandra: That i'm getting only 1800 and 1900 so should I continue my business.

1740
02:57:46.650 --> 02:57:51.420
Sharat Chandra: Know obviously no definitely why because this condition is not satisfied.

1741
02:57:55.980 --> 02:57:56.190
Sharat Chandra: Linda.

1742
02:57:58.800 --> 02:58:11.220
Sharat Chandra: If my business is 1900 to 2100 I mean if this is the confidence interval the time it gets to this case one this is case should I continue, or should I stop.

1743
02:58:15.030 --> 02:58:17.370
Rachana Kumbha: may continue and consider to continue.

1744
02:58:18.780 --> 02:58:22.050
Paramesh Putha: you're not launching are all the customers, maybe.

1745
02:58:23.430 --> 02:58:25.200
Sharat Chandra: This will you have lunch, the population.

1746
02:58:25.830 --> 02:58:29.190
Sharat Chandra: that's the objective you cannot say I only lunch for so many know.

1747
02:58:30.720 --> 02:58:32.460
Sharat Chandra: it's what all the customers we're generalizing.

1748
02:58:33.390 --> 02:58:39.750
Paramesh Putha: Then, maybe know because, like there's a chance of 1900 also so not meeting $2,000.

1749
02:58:40.800 --> 02:58:42.150
Rachana Kumbha: Okay, Peter completed, we.

1750
02:58:42.870 --> 02:58:44.460
Rachana Kumbha: should start from 2000.

1751
02:58:45.660 --> 02:58:51.210
Sharat Chandra: Okay, yes, Sir 1900 to 2020 2100 basically is nothing but.

1752
02:58:54.420 --> 02:58:55.740
Sharat Chandra: This is less than buddha's.

1753
02:58:58.680 --> 02:59:10.920
Sharat Chandra: Okay, see if you're doing a business right you're investing thousand dollars you're doing some tasks and you're exactly getting thousand bucks in returns is this a good business model.

1754
02:59:12.690 --> 02:59:13.020
Paramesh Putha: No.

1755
02:59:14.760 --> 02:59:18.690
Sharat Chandra: No right, it has to be greater, it has to be greater than what you have.

1756
02:59:18.690 --> 02:59:20.130
Sharat Chandra: invested on it, then you proceed.

1757
02:59:21.420 --> 02:59:28.110
Sharat Chandra: So 2000 is the return on investment racing if I get $2,000, then the investment is returned.

1758
02:59:29.280 --> 02:59:44.460
Sharat Chandra: I need more than 2000 to become profitable, so you are going to only look into the case if you are range is going to start from 2001 to probably 2005 or 2500 whatever that number.

1759
02:59:46.200 --> 02:59:48.330
Sharat Chandra: Only if you're identifying.

1760
02:59:49.560 --> 02:59:58.560
Sharat Chandra: Your confidence interval being like this, compared to 2000 only in this case, you will proceed with the investment and and proceed with the business.

1761
03:00:01.530 --> 03:00:02.700
Sharat Chandra: Here we are doing.

1762
03:00:02.820 --> 03:00:14.550
Sharat Chandra: Our informed decisions you taking a informed decisions and this informed decisions are also known as data driven decisions.

1763
03:00:15.840 --> 03:00:21.870
Sharat Chandra: Rather than blindly saying okay this area, the business will be very good this business ideas very good let's invest.

1764
03:00:23.220 --> 03:00:31.800
Sharat Chandra: Right, rather than that blind hand, these are decisions we basically come up with this data driven decisions are informed.

1765
03:00:37.350 --> 03:00:38.550
Sharat Chandra: Right good.

1766
03:00:51.570 --> 03:00:52.350
Sharat Chandra: Is it clear yes.

1767
03:00:53.850 --> 03:00:54.180
Paramesh Putha: Yes.

1768
03:00:55.320 --> 03:00:55.920
Rachana Kumbha: Yes, sir.

1769
03:01:07.050 --> 03:01:07.530
Okay.

1770
03:01:13.290 --> 03:01:18.810
Sharat Chandra: This concept that we just discussed right is also called as hypothesis testing.

1771
03:01:19.920 --> 03:01:22.020
Sharat Chandra: Information based on data.

1772
03:01:24.510 --> 03:01:31.320
Sharat Chandra: Now this hypothesis testing is not being focused in the interview, so we also have remote from our regular.

1773
03:01:32.400 --> 03:01:32.970
sessions.

1774
03:01:34.050 --> 03:01:47.160
Sharat Chandra: at once upon a time, is this concepts were considered for interviews now they're not asking anything from this particular questions, so I only cover the theory particle theory, but then we'll move on to the next.

1775
03:01:48.180 --> 03:01:48.540
Sharat Chandra: So.

1776
03:01:48.990 --> 03:01:52.770
Sharat Chandra: You can just continue with recording you can do the practice yes.

1777
03:01:53.460 --> 03:02:09.540
Paramesh Putha: So before like, as we have unwritten the numerical kind of production kind of thing like I have adults are like in assignments, in addition, three assignments actually have to predict the company's date of sales, like the output is a numeric.

1778
03:02:12.120 --> 03:02:13.890
Sharat Chandra: Decision tree the desert has to be.

1779
03:02:13.890 --> 03:02:22.170
Paramesh Putha: Here, because it has to be taken, but like no matter like how many times the accuracies like it's a big plus.

1780
03:02:23.550 --> 03:02:26.850
Sharat Chandra: That means, be a bad idea tuning has to be tried more.

1781
03:02:28.530 --> 03:02:34.530
Sharat Chandra: It has nothing to do with the classification or numeric data, it is all about the parameters that you're trying.

1782
03:02:35.370 --> 03:02:40.230
Paramesh Putha: So that is also numeric data right like continuous numeric data than white on please conference.

1783
03:02:42.180 --> 03:02:44.370
Sharat Chandra: automatically your confidence interval is calculated.

1784
03:02:45.600 --> 03:02:49.140
Paramesh Putha: Okay, by default, like in those packets like they shouldn't be.

1785
03:02:50.670 --> 03:03:01.050
Sharat Chandra: Any regrets at model, the calculation that you are doing, will, by default, assume 95% confidence, and you are going to actually get confidence interval.

1786
03:03:02.430 --> 03:03:12.600
Sharat Chandra: Okay, to the calculations will not give you this interval in certain cases, the intervals, are also can what you can at this point estimate only.

1787
03:03:13.260 --> 03:03:21.240
Paramesh Putha: Okay, so, in those cases like invasion to eat better like internally is calculating all those things that conference and we're not.

1788
03:03:21.510 --> 03:03:25.230
Sharat Chandra: Even take the parameters, the confidence interval is also that yes.

1789
03:03:29.310 --> 03:03:29.850
Paramesh Putha: that's it's.

1790
03:03:32.910 --> 03:03:36.570
Sharat Chandra: very, very simple guys if my data is numeric.

1791
03:03:39.330 --> 03:03:41.700
Sharat Chandra: Right and if it is especially continuous.

1792
03:03:43.980 --> 03:03:46.830
Sharat Chandra: Because my underlying sample changes.

1793
03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:51.960
Sharat Chandra: That and and the length sample changes.

1794
03:03:53.550 --> 03:03:57.150
Sharat Chandra: The result so to capture that variation.

1795
03:03:58.770 --> 03:04:01.290
Sharat Chandra: We use confidence interval.

1796
03:04:04.320 --> 03:04:04.590
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1797
03:04:08.850 --> 03:04:25.320
Sharat Chandra: Okay, and if the prediction that that you're getting is a numeric prediction the numerical but then the model is coldness regression model or aggressors if the model is giving non numerical but then it is called, as a class that's yes.

1798
03:04:28.200 --> 03:04:28.890
Sharat Chandra: Okay next.

1799
03:04:29.910 --> 03:04:33.180
Sharat Chandra: hypothesis testing, as I explained is all about.

1800
03:04:34.740 --> 03:04:38.130
Sharat Chandra: Making certain assumptions for parameters.

1801
03:04:41.880 --> 03:04:45.900
Sharat Chandra: But because parameters cannot be identified, we will take sample.

1802
03:04:47.760 --> 03:04:50.640
Sharat Chandra: From population, and then we calculate statistics.

1803
03:04:51.780 --> 03:04:58.110
Sharat Chandra: And while making estimations we use confidence interval for estimating the path.

1804
03:04:59.790 --> 03:05:02.010
Sharat Chandra: and using the estimated.

1805
03:05:03.180 --> 03:05:05.730
Sharat Chandra: Estimated results.

1806
03:05:06.870 --> 03:05:09.180
Sharat Chandra: We will take business decisions.

1807
03:05:11.520 --> 03:05:13.200
Sharat Chandra: But when you're trying to do this.

1808
03:05:14.790 --> 03:05:16.080
Sharat Chandra: There might be cases where.

1809
03:05:17.340 --> 03:05:17.820
Sharat Chandra: You may go.

1810
03:05:19.320 --> 03:05:26.340
Sharat Chandra: Okay, so there are certain terminologies or certain standard process that you have to follow, let us try and understand that process.

1811
03:05:29.550 --> 03:05:29.880
Sharat Chandra: Next.

1812
03:05:33.510 --> 03:05:40.140
Sharat Chandra: let's it the business that we are speaking right was having an Roi as 2000.

1813
03:05:43.980 --> 03:05:44.250
Sharat Chandra: Then.

1814
03:05:52.590 --> 03:05:55.110
i'll put it this way okay.

1815
03:05:58.140 --> 03:06:08.460
Sharat Chandra: So first case right, if I have to take a business decision on whether to launch credit card offer to be and then credit cards to the customer service.

1816
03:06:12.630 --> 03:06:14.490
Sharat Chandra: lines credit packs Okay, this is the.

1817
03:06:16.080 --> 03:06:22.320
Sharat Chandra: Right, so if I have to launch credit card and i'm basically taking a decision okay.

1818
03:06:23.880 --> 03:06:25.650
Sharat Chandra: What would be your.

1819
03:06:27.150 --> 03:06:28.020
Sharat Chandra: First.

1820
03:06:31.290 --> 03:06:31.950
Sharat Chandra: Decision a.

1821
03:06:35.520 --> 03:06:38.430
Sharat Chandra: Safer decision yeah, this is the question.

1822
03:06:40.140 --> 03:06:42.060
Sharat Chandra: What will be your safer decision.

1823
03:06:47.580 --> 03:06:52.380
Sharat Chandra: Any new change that you're bringing in there's nothing but a business challenge.

1824
03:06:54.090 --> 03:06:54.420
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1825
03:06:58.140 --> 03:06:58.860
Paramesh Putha: So you can score.

1826
03:06:59.910 --> 03:07:01.890
Paramesh Putha: 37 score.

1827
03:07:03.150 --> 03:07:03.480
Similar.

1828
03:07:05.670 --> 03:07:09.330
Sharat Chandra: Basically score is coming, what is the question you are the manager of the Bank.

1829
03:07:09.450 --> 03:07:10.680
Sharat Chandra: mean you're the head of the Bank.

1830
03:07:11.970 --> 03:07:20.100
Sharat Chandra: You have a decision to be taken, what is the decision should I launched the credit card to the customers or not.

1831
03:07:20.610 --> 03:07:21.330
Okay.

1832
03:07:24.420 --> 03:07:24.660
yeah.

1833
03:07:26.190 --> 03:07:27.210
Sharat Chandra: If this is the key.

1834
03:07:27.240 --> 03:07:27.690
Is.

1835
03:07:31.350 --> 03:07:32.880
Sharat Chandra: Then, what will be your answer.

1836
03:07:41.070 --> 03:07:55.200
Rachana Kumbha: So this is, it is exactly like $2,000 is the return on investment, like we don't know, we need to consider the plus and minus cases also right so it's exactly the same value, there may be a minus case or so so.

1837
03:07:55.530 --> 03:07:57.510
Rachana Kumbha: It should, no, no, no, no, no okay again okay.

1838
03:07:57.690 --> 03:08:00.120
Sharat Chandra: hold on hold on we're not talking about.

1839
03:08:01.500 --> 03:08:02.370
Sharat Chandra: Our our you.

1840
03:08:02.430 --> 03:08:06.510
Sharat Chandra: know our role is a condition see as a manager, as the.

1841
03:08:07.740 --> 03:08:14.970
Sharat Chandra: head of the band, you have to take a decision but you're saying that Okay, if I have to be implemented, this is the investment that I have to put.

1842
03:08:15.300 --> 03:08:24.840
Sharat Chandra: If I get only this kind of returns, only then it will be profitable that these kind of decisions you're looking at already I mean sorry this kind of information you're also looking at.

1843
03:08:26.580 --> 03:08:27.750
Sharat Chandra: As part of that I said.

1844
03:08:28.500 --> 03:08:29.730
Sharat Chandra: If the business gets.

1845
03:08:29.760 --> 03:08:33.090
Sharat Chandra: Minimum $2,000, then the money is right or at it.

1846
03:08:35.160 --> 03:08:47.850
Sharat Chandra: From that aspect of return that forget about the question here, all you have to think about us there is a business decision that you need to take should I launched the credit card to the customers are not.

1847
03:08:48.210 --> 03:08:55.020
Rachana Kumbha: So, as we like previously discussed, probably the launch a pilot program like will will choose very few people and launch it.

1848
03:08:55.260 --> 03:08:58.110
Sharat Chandra: Is that is the process that you are implementing.

1849
03:08:58.830 --> 03:09:02.220
Sharat Chandra: To get the data and then taken informed decisions but.

1850
03:09:03.270 --> 03:09:04.350
Before that i'm saying.

1851
03:09:06.420 --> 03:09:08.160
Sharat Chandra: Maybe if you have a decision.

1852
03:09:09.120 --> 03:09:13.290
Paramesh Putha: You have to consider risk risk factor select even be.

1853
03:09:13.830 --> 03:09:17.820
Sharat Chandra: plan Basra on look at all those things guys take simple steps.

1854
03:09:17.820 --> 03:09:23.970
Sharat Chandra: My question is, will you launch the credit card or not, what two options, you have.

1855
03:09:25.050 --> 03:09:26.610
Sharat Chandra: There will be two options only that.

1856
03:09:27.810 --> 03:09:31.470
Sharat Chandra: If certain parts are all going to come when you're going to detail into that.

1857
03:09:32.880 --> 03:09:41.640
Sharat Chandra: I ultimately for this question what two answers you have there will be only two answers, yes, you launch no you don't look.

1858
03:09:42.390 --> 03:09:43.260
Sharat Chandra: Now, getting me.

1859
03:09:45.090 --> 03:09:47.340
Sharat Chandra: Given this scenario.

1860
03:09:49.710 --> 03:09:54.720
Sharat Chandra: Which one would you prefer as a risk less scenarios.

1861
03:09:55.530 --> 03:09:57.270
Paramesh Putha: are giving them, obviously we choose to launch the credit.

1862
03:09:58.230 --> 03:09:59.310
Sharat Chandra: Is that riskless.

1863
03:10:00.120 --> 03:10:03.720
Rachana Kumbha: feud launch that there may be losses also if you launch it so.

1864
03:10:03.780 --> 03:10:06.030
Sharat Chandra: Exactly the riskiest rate.

1865
03:10:09.240 --> 03:10:11.040
Sharat Chandra: so to speak, is walking.

1866
03:10:14.100 --> 03:10:22.470
Sharat Chandra: See whatever you're currently doing you're assuming that that is a good scenario that is a good status that you are in all conditions are good.

1867
03:10:23.670 --> 03:10:26.100
Sharat Chandra: That is the default assumption.

1868
03:10:28.260 --> 03:10:30.630
Sharat Chandra: We also call it us status Q.

1869
03:10:34.710 --> 03:10:35.070
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1870
03:10:36.540 --> 03:10:47.670
Sharat Chandra: Now, what is your default or current condition for the business, no, it does not have credit cards it's just running the regular business bank is running the regular banking business, there is no credit cards.

1871
03:10:48.930 --> 03:10:52.560
Sharat Chandra: So this will be your default assumption.

1872
03:10:54.960 --> 03:10:55.350
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

1873
03:10:56.550 --> 03:10:57.930
Sharat Chandra: Do not learn, so my bad.

1874
03:11:01.140 --> 03:11:02.970
Sharat Chandra: you're going to say, do not know.

1875
03:11:04.710 --> 03:11:09.960
Sharat Chandra: This is also called as no action decision or no action condition.

1876
03:11:11.970 --> 03:11:14.370
Sharat Chandra: This is called is null.

1877
03:11:15.390 --> 03:11:17.820
Sharat Chandra: hypothesis hypothesis means.

1878
03:11:18.480 --> 03:11:19.590
Sharat Chandra: assumptions right.

1879
03:11:22.200 --> 03:11:26.370
Sharat Chandra: How about this as means assumption, so the thing null hypothesis.

1880
03:11:28.770 --> 03:11:31.590
Sharat Chandra: Now means no X you're not doing anything.

1881
03:11:33.510 --> 03:11:39.090
Sharat Chandra: If you don't do anything that that means your current condition is assumed to be good right or default condition of current current.

1882
03:11:41.910 --> 03:11:44.940
Sharat Chandra: So this is the not launch case.

1883
03:11:47.790 --> 03:11:48.180
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

1884
03:11:49.740 --> 03:11:58.860
Sharat Chandra: But there is a business decision that we need to take should I launch the credit card or not, if that question comes riskless.

1885
03:12:00.960 --> 03:12:06.030
Sharat Chandra: Decision is go with your current conditions that means don't do something different.

1886
03:12:07.650 --> 03:12:19.140
Sharat Chandra: But if you can find an evidence which says that if you launch credit card you're going to get benefited it basically means.

1887
03:12:20.460 --> 03:12:22.020
Sharat Chandra: If you take action.

1888
03:12:25.110 --> 03:12:31.530
Sharat Chandra: Right find evidence which says you take action and you get profitable in that case, obviously launch.

1889
03:12:33.270 --> 03:12:33.570
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1890
03:12:34.920 --> 03:12:42.150
Sharat Chandra: So the first condition is this in that business scenario, the alternate condition will be launched the grid.

1891
03:12:43.710 --> 03:12:46.230
Sharat Chandra: So it's called as alternate hypothesis.

1892
03:12:47.430 --> 03:12:56.550
Sharat Chandra: Take action condition alternate hypothesis So here we say launch, because that is the action that we are trying to evaluate.

1893
03:12:57.660 --> 03:13:01.170
Sharat Chandra: But in order to come to this, we need evidence.

1894
03:13:02.460 --> 03:13:05.730
Sharat Chandra: That evidence is what we were trying to calculate it the previous exam.

1895
03:13:06.960 --> 03:13:12.480
Sharat Chandra: So we need parameter details, but we not get parameter details so we'll take.

1896
03:13:13.590 --> 03:13:16.050
Sharat Chandra: Care sample and then calculated statistics.

1897
03:13:18.450 --> 03:13:27.390
Sharat Chandra: But based on right the decisions have to be taken a parameter, so we will first make these statements or make those conditions.

1898
03:13:29.130 --> 03:13:36.150
Sharat Chandra: Using parameters Okay, then we'll take sample than statistics, then using statistics.

1899
03:13:37.230 --> 03:13:39.540
Sharat Chandra: We will try to estimate parameters.

1900
03:13:43.290 --> 03:13:46.380
Sharat Chandra: and using that estimated parameters take decisions.

1901
03:13:49.590 --> 03:13:49.920
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

1902
03:13:53.640 --> 03:13:57.360
Sharat Chandra: No null hypothesis represent rise, which not H zero.

1903
03:13:59.280 --> 03:14:04.110
Sharat Chandra: alternate hypothesis represented as hitched a or you can also say which one.

1904
03:14:05.790 --> 03:14:08.220
Sharat Chandra: In a hypothesis an alternate hypothesis.

1905
03:14:11.820 --> 03:14:12.180
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

1906
03:14:14.130 --> 03:14:14.400
Sharat Chandra: But.

1907
03:14:15.600 --> 03:14:34.380
Sharat Chandra: The decisions are to be based on certain conditions in this example that condition is taken from this Roi assumption that we made right, we were assuming that this was the calculation that was done in $2,000 was the return on investment mark.

1908
03:14:36.570 --> 03:14:38.340
Sharat Chandra: So when you do this calculation.

1909
03:14:40.380 --> 03:14:42.750
Sharat Chandra: you'll get estimated parameters.

1910
03:14:44.160 --> 03:14:45.180
Sharat Chandra: range right interval.

1911
03:14:47.550 --> 03:15:02.490
Sharat Chandra: So using that interval we will take a decision, so the statement that we will have the conditions that will right here for null hypothesis is that if, on an average parameter remember the statements have to be a parameter if on an average.

1912
03:15:03.990 --> 03:15:09.870
Sharat Chandra: The conditions are that I will get or the business will get less than or equal to.

1913
03:15:11.310 --> 03:15:12.660
Sharat Chandra: $2,000.

1914
03:15:13.860 --> 03:15:14.160
Sharat Chandra: hey.

1915
03:15:15.420 --> 03:15:19.050
Sharat Chandra: As a as the voltage right average balance.

1916
03:15:20.580 --> 03:15:21.420
Sharat Chandra: Then we will say.

1917
03:15:22.530 --> 03:15:25.800
Sharat Chandra: Not much no action and probably say.

1918
03:15:28.500 --> 03:15:29.820
Sharat Chandra: That means you're not launching them.

1919
03:15:31.380 --> 03:15:40.710
Sharat Chandra: But if you find out an evidence which says the calculations are going to give you greater than $2,000, then you will take.

1920
03:15:44.190 --> 03:15:44.760
Sharat Chandra: Care guys.

1921
03:15:48.630 --> 03:15:51.900
Sharat Chandra: We are framing the conditions we are framing those scenarios.

1922
03:15:53.310 --> 03:16:00.210
Sharat Chandra: quantifying those and then using the calculations, using the results from population sample.

1923
03:16:01.320 --> 03:16:01.740
Sharat Chandra: We will.

1924
03:16:02.790 --> 03:16:07.050
Sharat Chandra: Try to conclude on what decision we have to take in a business condition.

1925
03:16:10.680 --> 03:16:11.040
Sharat Chandra: Clear.

1926
03:16:15.660 --> 03:16:16.230
Rachana Kumbha: Yes, sir.

1927
03:16:17.490 --> 03:16:20.370
Sharat Chandra: yeah we're still kind of looking at university to.

1928
03:16:20.400 --> 03:16:20.610
Rachana Kumbha: Be.

1929
03:16:21.540 --> 03:16:36.030
Sharat Chandra: If certain parts are always dead, if this condition is changing of that condition is changing we'll deal with that, but for now, this is basically a simple example of your hypothesis testing, which basically allows us to do the.

1930
03:16:37.500 --> 03:16:40.320
Sharat Chandra: inferential statistics for taking a business decision.

1931
03:16:42.870 --> 03:16:43.140
Right.

1932
03:16:44.850 --> 03:16:45.150
Sharat Chandra: Now.

1933
03:16:49.170 --> 03:16:52.050
Sharat Chandra: We have seen confusion matrix right, I mean the cost table.

1934
03:16:53.700 --> 03:16:54.060
Sharat Chandra: isn't it.

1935
03:16:56.220 --> 03:16:58.080
Sharat Chandra: it's a two by two table that we have see.

1936
03:17:01.080 --> 03:17:02.490
Sharat Chandra: Those similar lines.

1937
03:17:03.630 --> 03:17:05.340
Sharat Chandra: Here also, we have a two by two table.

1938
03:17:06.720 --> 03:17:13.410
Sharat Chandra: Okay, and that two by two table basically gives us insights on kind of decisions.

1939
03:17:15.300 --> 03:17:16.800
Sharat Chandra: and wrong decisions.

1940
03:17:19.170 --> 03:17:19.740
Sharat Chandra: Very simple.

1941
03:17:21.180 --> 03:17:22.500
Sharat Chandra: If this is the condition.

1942
03:17:23.640 --> 03:17:27.330
Sharat Chandra: I should not launch the business right, I mean I should not launch the credit isn't it.

1943
03:17:28.440 --> 03:17:29.640
Sharat Chandra: If I come to know that.

1944
03:17:31.560 --> 03:17:37.290
Sharat Chandra: My balance is going to be less than $2,000 which was like return on investment condition.

1945
03:17:38.880 --> 03:17:40.800
Sharat Chandra: Then I should not be launching my business right.

1946
03:17:43.140 --> 03:17:43.560
Sharat Chandra: isn't it.

1947
03:17:48.180 --> 03:17:53.190
Sharat Chandra: But in this case, if I go ahead and take action, what happens.

1948
03:17:56.760 --> 03:17:58.380
Sharat Chandra: yeah in this case, what will happen this.

1949
03:18:12.930 --> 03:18:13.290
Sharat Chandra: What happens.

1950
03:18:21.840 --> 03:18:23.010
Sharat Chandra: Is this not clear.

1951
03:18:31.200 --> 03:18:33.090
Sharat Chandra: Is it clear or not clear, the question.

1952
03:18:35.970 --> 03:18:37.650
Rachana Kumbha: So, can you repeat the questions.

1953
03:18:38.670 --> 03:18:39.030
up.

1954
03:18:40.980 --> 03:18:42.660
Sharat Chandra: So same business scenario.

1955
03:18:43.350 --> 03:18:44.730
Sharat Chandra: Okay now.

1956
03:18:45.840 --> 03:18:51.660
Sharat Chandra: The return on investment was saying $232,000 is what the average balance should be made by each customer.

1957
03:18:53.580 --> 03:19:03.120
Sharat Chandra: When you did the calculation you found that the business right is not generating balance with the customers are not maintaining the balance which is greater than.

1958
03:19:04.620 --> 03:19:06.180
Sharat Chandra: balances less than or equal to.

1959
03:19:08.490 --> 03:19:12.180
Sharat Chandra: So in this case I should not be launching my credit card right.

1960
03:19:15.180 --> 03:19:15.630
Rachana Kumbha: Yes.

1961
03:19:16.710 --> 03:19:24.780
Sharat Chandra: But if we take action, take action to launch in this case, it is only two decisions if I take action, then what will happen in this case.

1962
03:19:25.020 --> 03:19:27.480
Rachana Kumbha: going to Los yes.

1963
03:19:27.510 --> 03:19:29.430
Sharat Chandra: We are going into losses.

1964
03:19:31.980 --> 03:19:34.680
Sharat Chandra: Similarly, I come to know that.

1965
03:19:36.660 --> 03:19:40.680
Sharat Chandra: The balance is going to be greater than $2,000 that the people are maintaining.

1966
03:19:42.330 --> 03:19:47.550
Sharat Chandra: But rather than taking action i'm saying i'm too lazy not to take action.

1967
03:19:50.430 --> 03:19:51.270
Sharat Chandra: In this case, water.

1968
03:19:52.830 --> 03:19:55.350
Rachana Kumbha: We just remain where we are there's no growth.

1969
03:19:56.550 --> 03:19:59.310
Sharat Chandra: Exactly the chance of.

1970
03:19:59.610 --> 03:20:01.620
Sharat Chandra: Becoming profitable is.

1971
03:20:01.650 --> 03:20:04.050
Sharat Chandra: is reduced, we don't have the chance.

1972
03:20:05.970 --> 03:20:06.300
Sharat Chandra: Right.

1973
03:20:07.980 --> 03:20:12.990
Sharat Chandra: So there are correct decisions are you may also take the wrong decision.

1974
03:20:15.360 --> 03:20:21.870
Sharat Chandra: Correct, so there are two by two tables basically here that that we can create for options or net.

1975
03:20:23.070 --> 03:20:25.620
Sharat Chandra: And that two by two table can be explained like this.

1976
03:20:27.840 --> 03:20:46.020
Sharat Chandra: If you are null hypothesis is true that means, if you would have launched your credit card business, you would have gone into losses that's the condition that means your balance would have been less than or equal to $2,000 imagine, this would be the case, this was the case in real.

1977
03:20:47.910 --> 03:20:50.070
Sharat Chandra: Ideally, you have to.

1978
03:20:51.660 --> 03:20:59.700
Sharat Chandra: frame to reject the null condition fail to reject means you are your don't have you're basically not having evidence.

1979
03:21:00.870 --> 03:21:03.180
Sharat Chandra: To do something different from what you are doing, currently.

1980
03:21:04.650 --> 03:21:06.450
Sharat Chandra: Good that scholars fail to reject the.

1981
03:21:08.910 --> 03:21:10.830
Sharat Chandra: null hypothesis, the current condition right.

1982
03:21:12.810 --> 03:21:13.950
Sharat Chandra: you're doing that anyways.

1983
03:21:16.560 --> 03:21:22.680
Sharat Chandra: If you have evidence, you can change that condition, but here we are saying I don't have evidence to change.

1984
03:21:23.790 --> 03:21:34.650
Sharat Chandra: Right, when this is the scenario, you will go with null hypothesis for me, this is the right decision this is represented as confidence.

1985
03:21:36.060 --> 03:21:38.130
Sharat Chandra: that the value is lying in that confidence region.

1986
03:21:40.830 --> 03:21:41.310
Sharat Chandra: But if.

1987
03:21:43.290 --> 03:21:53.040
Sharat Chandra: But if, in this case, if you reject the null hypothesis that you're saying that no I will go ahead and take business decision and launch the credit card.

1988
03:21:54.900 --> 03:21:59.400
Sharat Chandra: If this is the scenario, then it is going to be wrong decision isn't it.

1989
03:22:02.670 --> 03:22:04.290
Sharat Chandra: This is wrong decision.

1990
03:22:06.270 --> 03:22:14.430
Sharat Chandra: We call this particular decision is Type one error, and this is represented as and far representation.

1991
03:22:18.900 --> 03:22:19.260
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

1992
03:22:21.600 --> 03:22:29.070
Sharat Chandra: This is one scenario now as Jim you're going to get greater than $2,000 that means you're going to get profits actually.

1993
03:22:30.150 --> 03:22:32.940
Sharat Chandra: But you're too lazy to take action.

1994
03:22:35.310 --> 03:22:42.420
Sharat Chandra: You fail to reject null hypothesis you're saying that no i'm too lazy I don't believe this a lot want to launch.

1995
03:22:43.440 --> 03:22:47.640
Sharat Chandra: The credit card so you're doing whatever is the current condition you're repeating.

1996
03:22:48.900 --> 03:22:51.510
Sharat Chandra: This is Type two error.

1997
03:22:52.950 --> 03:22:54.120
Sharat Chandra: represented us beta.

1998
03:22:55.890 --> 03:22:57.660
Sharat Chandra: This is also wrong decision.

1999
03:22:59.730 --> 03:23:02.550
Sharat Chandra: And finally, you have the right decision here.

2000
03:23:03.810 --> 03:23:06.840
Sharat Chandra: It says see if it is greater than 2000 you go ahead and launch it.

2001
03:23:08.190 --> 03:23:10.260
Sharat Chandra: reject your current condition and do something different.

2002
03:23:11.490 --> 03:23:12.090
Paramesh Putha: With this is.

2003
03:23:12.270 --> 03:23:14.400
Sharat Chandra: nothing but alternatives.

2004
03:23:16.260 --> 03:23:26.970
Sharat Chandra: So this is called as power of the test because, ultimately, this scenario is helping us to do something different from what we are doing, but take some action.

2005
03:23:29.220 --> 03:23:30.960
Sharat Chandra: And it's called as power of the test.

2006
03:23:33.360 --> 03:23:39.390
Sharat Chandra: Now Type one and Type two, these are the names case there is no other game, the errors are called has Type one and Type two.

2007
03:23:40.650 --> 03:23:45.300
Sharat Chandra: Type one error is dangerous because you're inviting lawsuits.

2008
03:23:46.380 --> 03:23:52.920
Sharat Chandra: You should not be taking any action you should be risk free but here you're getting into this you're inviting this.

2009
03:23:55.800 --> 03:23:56.100
Sharat Chandra: Right.

2010
03:23:57.540 --> 03:24:03.480
Sharat Chandra: Basically, a type one error is a condition, where you're taking action when you should not be.

2011
03:24:07.050 --> 03:24:08.040
Sharat Chandra: Taking action when.

2012
03:24:09.330 --> 03:24:11.070
Sharat Chandra: not required.

2013
03:24:13.290 --> 03:24:13.980
Sharat Chandra: Or you can say.

2014
03:24:15.240 --> 03:24:16.230
Sharat Chandra: you're rejecting.

2015
03:24:17.940 --> 03:24:18.240
Sharat Chandra: It.

2016
03:24:20.790 --> 03:24:26.880
Sharat Chandra: Through null hypothesis, this is your Type one represented with and.

2017
03:24:29.880 --> 03:24:35.100
Sharat Chandra: This is not taking action just exactly opposite to not taking.

2018
03:24:36.720 --> 03:24:38.310
Sharat Chandra: Not taking action.

2019
03:24:40.530 --> 03:24:41.520
Sharat Chandra: when required.

2020
03:24:43.290 --> 03:24:44.280
Sharat Chandra: Not is coming here.

2021
03:24:45.360 --> 03:24:52.020
Sharat Chandra: that's your type do, or you can say you're failing to reject a false null hypothesis.

2022
03:24:54.000 --> 03:24:54.780
Sharat Chandra: cradle to reject.

2023
03:24:56.520 --> 03:24:58.380
Sharat Chandra: falls null hypothesis.

2024
03:25:02.280 --> 03:25:05.580
Sharat Chandra: Okay, this is called as Type two error, which is represent recipe.

2025
03:25:08.880 --> 03:25:09.900
Sharat Chandra: I found it clear.

2026
03:25:19.170 --> 03:25:19.800
Sharat Chandra: Okay now.

2027
03:25:22.020 --> 03:25:29.280
Sharat Chandra: Based on what we are trying to estimate the value that we are trying to estimate right there are different tests that we have to perform.

2028
03:25:30.420 --> 03:25:36.150
Sharat Chandra: What we have seen that the Z test and the T test that we have seen is.

2029
03:25:37.890 --> 03:25:47.430
Sharat Chandra: For continuous case, your why the output that you're trying to predict, if it is continuous then we follow these right flow charts.

2030
03:25:48.900 --> 03:25:51.000
Sharat Chandra: And we discussed with respect to.

2031
03:25:52.710 --> 03:25:53.010
Sharat Chandra: This.

2032
03:25:54.030 --> 03:25:54.690
Sharat Chandra: Z test.

2033
03:25:55.710 --> 03:26:03.960
Sharat Chandra: On Peters, this is what we discussed when Sigma was known we go through here Sigma is not known we go for.

2034
03:26:06.330 --> 03:26:09.600
Sharat Chandra: Similarly, we have various other test cases.

2035
03:26:10.680 --> 03:26:13.920
Sharat Chandra: Based on different conditions, but all these different test cases are.

2036
03:26:15.300 --> 03:26:17.190
Sharat Chandra: For bias continuous case.

2037
03:26:18.600 --> 03:26:20.850
Sharat Chandra: Similarly, we will also have.

2038
03:26:23.280 --> 03:26:26.160
Sharat Chandra: The test cases which are applied for.

2039
03:26:27.210 --> 03:26:32.700
Sharat Chandra: discrete cases as well, but discrete cases are always easier to calculate.

2040
03:26:33.780 --> 03:26:34.770
Sharat Chandra: Okay, remember that.

2041
03:26:36.180 --> 03:26:42.780
Sharat Chandra: You don't have complex complication when your output as discrete data, you simply take proportion as.

2042
03:26:43.800 --> 03:26:45.750
Sharat Chandra: Well, what proportion to proportion of high school.

2043
03:26:47.820 --> 03:26:59.490
Sharat Chandra: So these are basically different options of your inferential statistics, and these are not limited only to these, but you have a lot of other use cases also.

2044
03:27:00.780 --> 03:27:03.570
Sharat Chandra: But always remember when it is continuous, you will have a chat.

2045
03:27:07.410 --> 03:27:11.970
Sharat Chandra: Okay, various various various things have to be verified normality test has to be checked right.

2046
03:27:13.260 --> 03:27:18.660
Sharat Chandra: All those conditions have to be verified and if you follow that flow chart you will probably be able to.

2047
03:27:19.770 --> 03:27:21.300
Sharat Chandra: Go indie film.

2048
03:27:23.640 --> 03:27:30.450
Sharat Chandra: All right now for detailed discussion of these hypothesis testing, you can refer to the recommended videos.

2049
03:27:31.950 --> 03:27:40.890
Sharat Chandra: But yeah, as I mentioned, theoretically, the subject is more important because in interviews more advanced things that we focus now, these things are not being asked.

2050
03:27:44.880 --> 03:27:45.360
Sharat Chandra: Right yeah.

2051
03:27:46.770 --> 03:27:48.030
Sharat Chandra: So this is about your.

2052
03:27:50.100 --> 03:27:53.310
Sharat Chandra: hypothesis testing or inferential statistics.

2053
03:27:54.900 --> 03:28:04.350
Sharat Chandra: This concepts that we discussed right these concepts that we discussed here, especially your confidence interval nclb its central limit theorem.

2054
03:28:05.520 --> 03:28:12.510
Sharat Chandra: will form the base for doing the predictions, especially when you have output, which is American.

2055
03:28:13.920 --> 03:28:17.730
Sharat Chandra: In our next, yes, we will start with regression is.

2056
03:28:19.320 --> 03:28:19.590
Sharat Chandra: Now.

2057
03:28:21.630 --> 03:28:27.300
Sharat Chandra: So what exactly means regression if i'm I continue of output as continuous then.

2058
03:28:28.440 --> 03:28:37.830
Sharat Chandra: or put logic, we are to apply, and then we also have variations in regressions some of them are not so important, but yeah we still have those techniques.

2059
03:28:39.120 --> 03:28:42.240
Sharat Chandra: Right, and this is more like I but unique concept.

2060
03:28:43.410 --> 03:28:53.400
Sharat Chandra: And these are some of the advanced regression techniques that we have, which are not used anymore in the industry from statistical standpoint, we have those concepts.

2061
03:28:54.660 --> 03:29:02.640
Sharat Chandra: But was the regression, we will move to time series, and finally, we will go to black box or will do black box and then boogie times.

2062
03:29:06.120 --> 03:29:11.580
Sharat Chandra: So that's the future classes next week's guess we'll start with regression analysis.

2063
03:29:13.650 --> 03:29:14.640
Sharat Chandra: Mark your attendance now.

2064
03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:27.840
Sharat Chandra: yeah brushing know.

2065
03:29:28.650 --> 03:29:42.000
NOOR ELAHI: So I have a doubt related to the hierarchical clustering so if you'll, allow me to, so the so my screen then i'll so because, in theory, the input, it is not an issue, because I have a doubt there are so many.

2066
03:29:42.840 --> 03:29:46.920
Sharat Chandra: After hold on let everybody finished the attendance part, then we will.

2067
03:29:47.640 --> 03:29:48.060
populate.

2068
03:29:51.150 --> 03:29:54.000
Sharat Chandra: yeah please confirm once the attendance part is done everyone.

2069
03:30:00.450 --> 03:30:02.670
Rachana Kumbha: So we have class next week so.

2070
03:30:04.080 --> 03:30:04.740
Sharat Chandra: What happened next.

2071
03:30:05.340 --> 03:30:06.570
Rachana Kumbha: gen first.

2072
03:30:07.470 --> 03:30:09.390
Sharat Chandra: Oh okay i'm.

2073
03:30:11.910 --> 03:30:15.300
Sharat Chandra: Dan first I don't think there is any heavy planning on.

2074
03:30:16.710 --> 03:30:16.920
Sharat Chandra: It we.

2075
03:30:18.210 --> 03:30:18.810
Sharat Chandra: have not done.

2076
03:30:19.350 --> 03:30:20.460
Rachana Kumbha: Okay yeah.

2077
03:30:20.580 --> 03:30:21.660
Sharat Chandra: 31st is locked down.

2078
03:30:23.250 --> 03:30:25.710
Rachana Kumbha: let's confirm so 31st and first logged on.

2079
03:30:26.910 --> 03:30:32.730
Sharat Chandra: i'm i'm not sure i'm not a party person mean hearing that 31st.

2080
03:30:33.900 --> 03:30:40.680
Sharat Chandra: There will be no movement outside everything will be logged in so again, assuming that is the case okay.

2081
03:30:42.000 --> 03:30:45.240
Rachana Kumbha: So when can we come to officer.

2082
03:30:46.320 --> 03:30:48.390
Rachana Kumbha: Like for the classes offline class.

2083
03:30:49.410 --> 03:31:05.460
Sharat Chandra: yeah I mean today, nobody will be there in office, and yesterday it was on holiday so cleaning and all those things will not, and that is the reason today's classes offline or online next week, we will see you for our officers, a Min we have our first then we'll we'll kind of go in office.

2084
03:31:05.910 --> 03:31:08.340
Rachana Kumbha: Okay, so I seem to be having class.

2085
03:31:09.420 --> 03:31:11.310
Sharat Chandra: I will confirm i'm not sure about.

2086
03:31:11.940 --> 03:31:17.550
Rachana Kumbha: Okay, so okay so so please inform like if it is offline class.

2087
03:31:18.330 --> 03:31:20.490
Sharat Chandra: yeah i'll mention that both things.

2088
03:31:21.060 --> 03:31:23.100
Paramesh Putha: Please very much preferable select event.

2089
03:31:24.900 --> 03:31:27.000
Rachana Kumbha: So you and I also see listening.

2090
03:31:27.600 --> 03:31:31.590
Sharat Chandra: Now I mean I understand a distance so we'll we'll try to have it offline.

2091
03:31:32.340 --> 03:31:32.970
Rachana Kumbha: Okay, so.

2092
03:31:34.350 --> 03:31:46.650
Sharat Chandra: That would do this, there was no problem, but I mean I would have come, but the challenge was with respect to the office, it would have not been cleaned and all that so probably, we will not be able to stay.

2093
03:31:49.980 --> 03:31:54.000
Sharat Chandra: Okay, Sir celebrations, and all those things happen on okay.

03:32:01.410 --> 03:32:01.590
yeah.

2096
03:32:06.450 --> 03:32:09.030
Rachana Kumbha: i'm done so Okay, thank you.

2097
03:32:10.770 --> 03:32:11.160
neerupa chauhan: So.

2098
03:32:13.080 --> 03:32:13.470
neerupa chauhan: Okay.

2099
03:32:16.770 --> 03:32:20.160
Sharat Chandra: Everyone please confirm or change the screen now.

2100
03:32:27.600 --> 03:32:31.860
Sharat Chandra: Okay i'm changing the screen assuming everybody's done don't don't come back and say I did not do it.

2101
03:32:33.930 --> 03:32:35.940
Sharat Chandra: Alright, so let's change.

2102
03:32:40.320 --> 03:32:40.950
The stone.

2103
03:32:42.870 --> 03:32:43.170
Sharat Chandra: yeah.

2104
03:32:44.460 --> 03:32:45.420
Sharat Chandra: No shadows.

2105
03:32:55.920 --> 03:32:56.160
NOOR ELAHI: Its.

2106
03:32:59.640 --> 03:33:01.020
NOOR ELAHI: east, west airlines data.

2107
03:33:02.250 --> 03:33:02.520
Sharat Chandra: Okay.

2108
03:33:02.730 --> 03:33:03.330
Hello.

2109
03:33:05.250 --> 03:33:19.620
NOOR ELAHI: There is a column called smiles and then because, as far as I am, you know i've been gone through this that I, there is a zero, and then the value is 2024, so it is kind of a kind of these outlets are so how can I deal with.

2110
03:33:20.850 --> 03:33:22.410
NOOR ELAHI: The first.

2111
03:33:22.680 --> 03:33:28.950
Sharat Chandra: date of the water you think would be appropriate, did you understand what a square miles means.

2112
03:33:34.770 --> 03:33:35.130
Sharat Chandra: Why is.

2113
03:33:36.390 --> 03:33:36.960
NOOR ELAHI: ready.

2114
03:33:41.610 --> 03:33:42.450
NOOR ELAHI: Yes, a place.

2115
03:33:44.040 --> 03:33:44.880
NOOR ELAHI: Where my.

2116
03:33:46.800 --> 03:33:49.170
NOOR ELAHI: countenance polycom for top right.

2117
03:33:50.460 --> 03:33:51.540
Sharat Chandra: Now, what does that mean.

2118
03:33:54.090 --> 03:34:02.910
Sharat Chandra: Number of miles countered as qualifying top flight miles right So what does that actually mean did you understand that first.

2119
03:34:04.680 --> 03:34:06.960
NOOR ELAHI: Most likely that is a concern.

2120
03:34:07.650 --> 03:34:08.220
NOOR ELAHI: Right you.

2121
03:34:09.600 --> 03:34:15.750
Sharat Chandra: Know see the point is no, you have to do a thorough understanding of the business conditions and the data.

2122
03:34:16.920 --> 03:34:19.800
Sharat Chandra: If you would have understood what does square miles means.

2123
03:34:20.820 --> 03:34:23.820
Sharat Chandra: Though the data description is given, but did you research on that.

2124
03:34:25.110 --> 03:34:31.230
Sharat Chandra: Did you try to ask a question on why is 2024 value their wise $500 value and suddenly by zero.

2125
03:34:32.460 --> 03:34:36.540
Sharat Chandra: If you would have done that art read that research, then.

2126
03:34:36.720 --> 03:34:38.190
Sharat Chandra: You should not have this.

2127
03:34:38.370 --> 03:34:41.250
Sharat Chandra: question in the first place, you should be able to take a decision.

2128
03:34:43.950 --> 03:34:47.130
Sharat Chandra: it's all about understanding the data that part is not done properly.

2129
03:34:48.150 --> 03:34:54.630
Sharat Chandra: Business understanding data understanding are going to be very, very to vote there was you not know what to do, or to do.

2130
03:35:03.360 --> 03:35:05.790
NOOR ELAHI: But before that i'll have competing.

2131
03:35:07.200 --> 03:35:09.060
NOOR ELAHI: Yes, I said, it is not only.

2132
03:35:10.320 --> 03:35:19.620
NOOR ELAHI: Not only just you know put in a data into the Python and then do the analysis as we usually do.

2133
03:35:20.190 --> 03:35:34.800
NOOR ELAHI: And after that we'll get the clusters and whatever the yes, it is not like, but before that i'll have to understand you know, business and then the that given this column wise, what are the variables.

2134
03:35:35.580 --> 03:35:36.360
NOOR ELAHI: So that is why.

2135
03:35:36.690 --> 03:35:37.590
NOOR ELAHI: Because things.

2136
03:35:38.700 --> 03:35:40.260
Sharat Chandra: Do not every information.

2137
03:35:41.520 --> 03:35:42.060
Sharat Chandra: question.

2138
03:35:42.450 --> 03:35:44.070
Sharat Chandra: itself, there is something.

2139
03:35:45.300 --> 03:35:47.220
Sharat Chandra: Which is expected from your side on so.

2140
03:35:48.420 --> 03:35:56.010
Sharat Chandra: That person will have to do research try and understand that business scenario try and understand what those columns me.

2141
03:35:57.390 --> 03:35:58.350
Sharat Chandra: That planning.

2142
03:35:58.380 --> 03:35:59.880
NOOR ELAHI: part is see.

2143
03:36:00.690 --> 03:36:01.110
Every.

2144
03:36:02.370 --> 03:36:14.310
Sharat Chandra: Once you get the data doing in Python as one asked what what to do, why to do something that you have to research and dried find out so that part is missing.

2145
03:36:15.570 --> 03:36:16.110
Okay.

2146
03:36:18.390 --> 03:36:19.440
NOOR ELAHI: Apart from this.

2147
03:36:20.820 --> 03:36:22.770
NOOR ELAHI: or two incidences fine yeah.

2148
03:36:30.390 --> 03:36:33.840
Sharat Chandra: No, no i'm losing you again, there is a.

2149
03:36:38.850 --> 03:36:39.480
NOOR ELAHI: Can you hear me.

2150
03:36:40.590 --> 03:36:43.140
Sharat Chandra: I can hear you Hello yeah yeah.

2151
03:36:43.170 --> 03:36:44.880
NOOR ELAHI: Now I can hear whether.

2152
03:36:47.070 --> 03:36:48.630
NOOR ELAHI: There is a one column in.

2153
03:36:50.490 --> 03:36:54.780
NOOR ELAHI: The date column, so how can I deal with this date column date.

2154
03:37:01.650 --> 03:37:03.750
Sharat Chandra: you're asking me the answer that.

2155
03:37:08.820 --> 03:37:09.750
Sharat Chandra: New research.

2156
03:37:13.980 --> 03:37:14.340
Sharat Chandra: yeah.

2157
03:37:15.270 --> 03:37:15.540
OK.

2158
03:37:18.540 --> 03:37:20.610
NOOR ELAHI: OK, I will okay very good.

2159
03:37:21.900 --> 03:37:22.320
NOOR ELAHI: And then.

2160
03:37:25.230 --> 03:37:28.680
NOOR ELAHI: Once the computer okay fine yeah.

2161
03:37:28.710 --> 03:37:31.710
Sharat Chandra: If you're if you're done research, and if you still start then.

2162
03:37:31.740 --> 03:37:32.760
NOOR ELAHI: yeah I can help you but.

2163
03:37:32.820 --> 03:37:33.930
Sharat Chandra: without doing your part.

2164
03:37:34.260 --> 03:37:34.650
NOOR ELAHI: I have.

2165
03:37:36.540 --> 03:37:40.770
NOOR ELAHI: literally just gone through the columns and all that we.

2166
03:37:46.200 --> 03:37:46.800
NOOR ELAHI: think you.

2167
03:37:48.600 --> 03:37:50.070
Sharat Chandra: should try it out.

2168
03:37:50.160 --> 03:37:50.610
NOOR ELAHI: Let me.

2169
03:37:51.810 --> 03:37:53.280
Sharat Chandra: Then i'll get the next session.

2170
03:37:54.780 --> 03:37:55.200
NOOR ELAHI: I think.

2171
03:37:57.270 --> 03:38:01.710
NOOR ELAHI: It is the most important part, I think, because I met.

2172
03:38:04.830 --> 03:38:05.010
NOOR ELAHI: My.

2173
03:38:06.510 --> 03:38:12.420
NOOR ELAHI: First start tuning this but insulated material, I thought you know what i'm saying.

2174
03:38:18.030 --> 03:38:20.730
Sharat Chandra: Not but yeah practice you're going in the right way.

2175
03:38:22.980 --> 03:38:23.370
Sharat Chandra: Small.

2176
03:38:24.570 --> 03:38:26.010
Sharat Chandra: focus on that one partner.

2177
03:38:26.100 --> 03:38:26.820
NOOR ELAHI: You should be able to.

2178
03:38:27.570 --> 03:38:29.280
Sharat Chandra: Clean clean these things.

2179
03:38:34.020 --> 03:38:35.430
NOOR ELAHI: Okay okay that's good.

2180
03:38:43.980 --> 03:38:48.030
Sharat Chandra: Okay anyone else any other questions anyone stuck at any point.

2181
03:38:55.170 --> 03:38:57.210
NOOR ELAHI: One thing one more.

2182
03:38:59.130 --> 03:39:01.740
NOOR ELAHI: Time boundaries and to submit all the assignments.

2183
03:39:02.340 --> 03:39:03.630
Sharat Chandra: No, no there's no time.

2184
03:39:05.160 --> 03:39:10.830
NOOR ELAHI: Because being a working person, it is you know, either because i'm you know.

2185
03:39:12.270 --> 03:39:17.130
Sharat Chandra: yeah I understand that's that's the reason we're saying no law deadlines.

2186
03:39:17.730 --> 03:39:19.080
Sharat Chandra: But the condition is.

2187
03:39:19.200 --> 03:39:25.740
Sharat Chandra: Unless until you finish your assignments and submit them, you will not be eligible for project.

2188
03:39:27.720 --> 03:39:27.990
NOOR ELAHI: Oh.

2189
03:39:30.120 --> 03:39:30.270
NOOR ELAHI: yeah.

2190
03:39:35.820 --> 03:39:38.880
Sharat Chandra: Okay, all right so we'll wind up and.

2191
03:39:39.330 --> 03:39:40.770
Monali s: I have one question can.

2192
03:39:47.130 --> 03:39:55.350
Monali s: I be burning the petition we go for it, there is no values to be go go for implementation or.

2193
03:39:55.410 --> 03:40:00.900
Monali s: If there are outliers in particular corner, so we should go for media implementation eight.

2194
03:40:01.860 --> 03:40:03.360
Sharat Chandra: Okay, yes yeah.

2195
03:40:03.660 --> 03:40:15.210
Monali s: So, so how how it is, first, we should like my question is, first, we should go for the implementation on first we should go for it out loud treatment, and then I.

2196
03:40:15.810 --> 03:40:16.740
Sharat Chandra: guess there is.

2197
03:40:16.800 --> 03:40:17.640
Sharat Chandra: There is no.

2198
03:40:19.080 --> 03:40:26.280
Sharat Chandra: Fixed procedure there Okay, you can try it out due to either of these things.

2199
03:40:27.450 --> 03:40:29.760
Sharat Chandra: see it again boils down to the question on.

2200
03:40:31.080 --> 03:40:48.900
Sharat Chandra: Why outlier what outlier why missing values that the variance right So if you if you look at those cases, you will be able to take a decision on saying that Okay, I have three the outlier first and then we probably will do the calculation of 11 calculation for invitation.

2201
03:40:50.190 --> 03:40:55.380
Sharat Chandra: it's a logical decision, and there is no standard rule that you have to do this faster than.

2202
03:40:57.480 --> 03:40:59.130
OK OK OK.

2203
03:41:00.270 --> 03:41:06.600
Monali s: mostly by typing for speech and go for it go for the invitation hello, can you hear me.

2204
03:41:07.170 --> 03:41:08.250
Sharat Chandra: yeah I can hear you but.

2205
03:41:09.420 --> 03:41:16.320
Sharat Chandra: I don't know i'm not sure where you have redacted there's no standard like that okay so it's.

2206
03:41:16.800 --> 03:41:18.840
Monali s: it's like everything.

2207
03:41:20.580 --> 03:41:21.450
Monali s: isn't it is it.

2208
03:41:21.540 --> 03:41:33.900
Sharat Chandra: No it's the individual's choice, of course, which is getting influenced by the data and the business conditions okay good Thank you, Sir.

2209
03:41:45.540 --> 03:41:48.450
Sharat Chandra: Okay, then let's wind up and reconnect next week.

2210
03:41:50.250 --> 03:41:51.180
Sharat Chandra: Thank you everyone.
